<p>Endless Bright Horizon, by Juan Berdugo</p>
<p>A gorgeous, expansive art-rock/chamber pop with very deliberate pacing - one of the year’s most contemplative records.</p>
<p>End of the Middle, by Richard Dawson</p>
<p>Perhaps more straightforward and less psychedelic than his other work, <em>End of the Middle</em> is still a thoughtful entry in Dawson’s catalog.</p>
<p>Birthing, by Swans</p>
<p>My favorite band!!! Gira &amp; co. truly do post-rock like no one else, and I was fortunate to see them live (9/5 in Washington D.C.) during this era which was a rapturous experience.</p>
<p>viagr aboys, by Viagra Boys</p>
<p>These freaky ass guys are back at it again! If you liked them before, you’ll probably like them now!</p>
<p>Animaru, by mei semones</p>
<p>A bit of chamber pop, a bit of bossa nova, and a bit of J-pop make for a refreshing, polished album.</p>
<p>Tranquilizer, by Oneohtrix Point Never</p>
<p>On this album, Oneohtrix pulls from commercial sample CDs to make a transient, ethereal album.</p>
<p>A Danger to Ourselves, by Lucrecia Dalt</p>
<p>While presenting very much like a pop album, Lucrecia Dalt concocts a lot of chin-scratching environments here by combining organic and industrial sounds in her instrumentals.</p>
<p>The Film, by Sumac &amp; Moor Mother</p>
<p>Combining Moor Mother’s Afrofuturist insurgency and the larger-than-life physicality of Sumac’s post-metal sound makes for one of 2025’s most apocalyptic listens.</p>
<p>Switcheroo, by Gelli haha</p>
<p>Every time I think I tire of synth-driven indie pop, a fun little catchy release pulls me back in. In this case, it was Gelli haha’s kooky, effervescent alternative dance debut record <em>Switcheroo.</em></p>
<p>In the Blue Light, by Kelela</p>
<p>On the best live album of 2025, Kelela revisits songs across her discography with lush, harp-kissed arrangements.</p>
<p>GUSH, by Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith</p>
<p>Forgoing some of her ambient textures for pulsing, deep basslines and sultry vocals, Smith concocted a record containing some of her most fun and sensual work.</p>
<p>Stardust, by Danny Brown</p>
<p>As explorative as ever, <em>Stardust</em> sees a legend collaborate with some of the most exciting up-and-coming artists/producers in experimental pop to expand his sound.</p>
<p>Sincerely, by Kali Uchis</p>
<p>This is a great Kali Uchis record, and stands with some of her best work! Just infinitely timeless, gorgeously sung and arranged.</p>
<p>Through the Wall, by Rochelle Jordan</p>
<p>Hypnotic, groovy, and nocturnal - after experimenting with many other electronic subgenres prior to now, <em>Through the Wall</em> sees Jordan embrace the sensual vibe of 90’s house.</p>
<p>A Study of Losses, by Beirut</p>
<p>On this expansive, brilliantly orchestrated album, Beirut chronicles impermanence to moving effect.</p>
<p>Welcome to My Blue Sky, by Momma</p>
<p>A road album that unpacks tales of longing and infidelity amid fuzzy, 90’s-indebted alt-rock.</p>
<p>Bugland, by No Joy</p>
<p>An immersive shoegaze-inspired record that is rife with thick guitars, digital textures and maximalism.</p>
<p>Touch, by Tortoise</p>
<p>With <em>Touch,</em> the post-rock veterans have returned with some of their most cinematic work in years, while keeping the overall sound pretty light.</p>
<p>Vegetables Worldwide, by vgtbl.pl</p>
<p>A bold, undeniably fun follow up to the Polish hyperpop duo’s electrifying <em>Komputer</em> EP.</p>
<p>The New Eve Is Rising, by The New Eves</p>
<p>Harkening avant-folk as well as more free form strains of post punk, The New Eves offer a boundary-pushing rebirth of womanhood on this ambitious album.</p>
<p>You’re Weird Now, by Guerilla Toss</p>
<p>On this quirky and well-crafted record, Guerilla Toss is at their most playful and delivers some of their catchiest songs yet (“Psychosis Is Just a Number” and “Life’s a Zoo”).</p>
<p>La Belleza, by Lido Pimienta</p>
<p>A brief, but heavenly string-laden effort.</p>
<p>For Melancholy Brunettes (&amp; Sad Women), by Japanese Breakfast</p>
<p>Michelle Zauner’s latest country-tinged effort offers some of her strongest orchestration, and both “Men in Bars” and “Winter in L.A.” are some of the best songs she has ever put out.</p>
<p>A Paradise in the Hold, by Yazz Ahmed</p>
<p>A standout jazz album from 2025 that explores the British-Bahraini trumpeter’s cultural identity.</p>
<p>Worldwide, by Snõõper</p>
<p>Sõ glad that Snõõper returned with their sõphõmõre effõrt this year!!! They make egg-punk like nõ õne else can.</p>
<p>I remember I forget, by Yasmine Hamdan</p>
<p>A gorgeous effort that combines Arab music with a number of different styles, from trip hop to ambient music.</p>
<p>DOGA, by Juana Molina</p>
<p>With strangely sticky melodies and eerie ambient electronics, <em>DOGA</em> is a fascinating record - I also am a fan of the album cover!</p>
