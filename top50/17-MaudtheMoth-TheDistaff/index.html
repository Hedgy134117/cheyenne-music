<h1>The Distaff by Maud the Moth</h1>
<img src="/imgs/MaudtheMoth-TheDistaff.jpg" />

<p>Few things can get me excited about music like a really good new neoclassical darkwave album. Thus, I was elated to discover Maud the Moth and her wonderful record <em>The Distaff</em> back in February. Largely led by Amaya López-Carromero’s powerful vocals and piano playing, <em>The Distaff</em> ebbs and flows between symphonic peaks, and often sounds like pure catharsis.</p>
<p>As the record flows, López-Carromero toys with a lot of different ways to achieve catharsis in different songs. The record has a lot of avant-metal leanings, which produces pummeling heights like that of “A temple by the river.” On “Siphonophores,” metal influence is present in the form of droning, blown-out guitars that sound more indebted to shoegaze. Undoubtedly, though, the nine-minute “Despenaperros” is the centerpiece of <em>The Distaff</em>, featuring slow-moving guitar and orchestral hits and epic choir-led vocals that greatly heighten the drama of the record. Whether she’s dealing in symphonic, metal, or piano-led palettes, <em>The Distaff</em> shows that Maud the Moth is a master of musical tension and release.</p>
