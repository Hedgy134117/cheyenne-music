A black metal album that rips through many extremes. I wasn’t particularly knowledgeable about all of the black metal albums that were released this year, but this one’s energy and textures caused it to linger with me significantly. With a pummelling and cathartic first side and a slow-burning and spiritual second side, *The Spiritual Sound* chronicles euphoric rebirth and vibrance.
