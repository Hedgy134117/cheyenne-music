I have to tell you… as far as Spanish-language albums go this year, *FEMME FATALE* was for me what Rosalia’s *LUX* seems to be for everyone else. I really adore this. The high-glam vibes are immaculate right off the bat with the title track, as we are immersed in the jazzy throwback vibe of the record. The smoky, nostalgic feel of the record is occasionally disrupted by Laferte’s own idiosyncrasies \- such as the autotune-laden vocals on “Mi Hombre” and the bombastic, explosive vocal performance on “Otra Noche de Llorar” (a track that completely warrants any BjÖrk comparisons it elicits).  

<!-- excerpt -->

One of my favorite things about *FEMME FATALE* is the fact that its penultimate track “My One And Only Love” combines Laferte’s vocal powers with those of two other legendary Latin American singers: Silvana Estrada and Natalia Lafourcade. The song itself is subtle and intimate with an underlying doo-wop rhythm, and it was just incredibly cool to see these three cross paths. Additionally, the other vocal collaborations on the record are also incredible \- particularly the Nathy Peluso-featured “La Tirana,” which has an infectious Latin jazz feel.
