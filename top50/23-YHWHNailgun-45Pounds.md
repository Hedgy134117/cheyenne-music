This debut project sees the four-piece, New York-based experimental rock group create tightly organized chaos. With precise, rototom-heavy percussion and noisy, sawing synths and guitar, tracks breeze by with pummeling intensity. The vibe the group creates is equally danceable and ritualistic, and makes for some very exciting experimental rock.
