Another record that speaks to the healing and introspective power of electronic music. *DÍA* came after a time of personal strife and uncertainty for Ela Minus after relocating during the pandemic, which is also when she began gaining traction for her debut record *acts of rebellion.* On this night-veiled follow-up, Ela looks inward while making her sound even more expansive (think Kelly Lee Owens). While hitting energetic highs, *DÍA* also rewards patient listeners with its meditative pacing \- for example, during the openers “ABRIR MONTE” and “BROKEN.” The former begins with a deep, two-chord synth that lingers throughout the latter, even when the anthemic chorus is introduced and bursts with melody and color.  

<!-- excerpt -->

The attitude of this album is world-weary, but mostly optimistic. On “BROKEN,” she sings “I’ll keep writing melodies/To sing away the gloom/That we have succumbed to.” “QQQ” is another highlight on the record \- its arpeggiated synths and rhythmic drum patterns make it feel anthemic. However, the lyrics reveal Ela’s apocalyptic emotions as she sings in Spanish, “If it’s going to be like this/Let the world end.” Her sentiments speak to the experience of attempting to heal and do better while the world seems to be slowly ending, and *DÍA* as a whole is a powerful attempt to reconcile these emotions.
