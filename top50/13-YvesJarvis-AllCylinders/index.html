<h1>All Cylinders by Yves Jarvis</h1>
<img src="/imgs/YvesJarvis-AllCylinders.jpg" />

<p>In my mind, Yves Jarvis has always occupied a very frenetic, “jack-of-all trades” place in experimental/indie music. He has such a knack for melody, and his whimsical sense of song structure tends to tease the listener with a great motif or melody before jumping to the next idea. Contrastingly, <em>All Cylinders</em> shows Yves Jarvis in a place of unparalleled concentration. The results are an absolute delight to the ear from front to back, as the psychedelic musician lets ideas linger for a bit longer and develop into fantastic, nostalgic tracks.</p>
<p>Yves Jarvis’ influences range far and wide on this project. The bombastic opener “With A Grain” equally recalls 60’s chamber pop and the more recent indie icon St. Vincent with its playful, slinking guitar passages. This is followed by “Gold Filigree” which is a fantastic exercise in early 70’s R&amp;B/soul slow jams, and “One Gripe,” which is full of pop shimmer and has some of the stickiest melodies on the album. Despite his omnivorous influences on <em>All Cylinder</em>, Yves concocts a sound that feels refreshing, and completely his own - one dream-like track at a time.</p>
