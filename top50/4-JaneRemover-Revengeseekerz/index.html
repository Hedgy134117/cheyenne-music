    <div class="review">
        <p>The fact that Jane Remover is one of the most recognizable names in experimental music merely 3 albums into their career is known by nearly everyone at this point. However, until <em>Revengeseekerz</em> came out this Spring, I don’t know if any of us knew they could rage <em>this</em> hard. Largely leaving behind the shoegaze-y sound of 2023’s <em>Census Designated, Revengeseekerz</em> sees the artist fully embrace rage, while giving it a spin that only they could give it.</p>
<p>“Overload” doesn’t even begin to describe what’s happening here - the tracks on <em>Revengeseekers</em> feel like they’re bursting at the seams with trap beats, bitcrushed synths, record scratches, samples, and whatever else Jane felt could fit into the mix. The result is an amalgam of hyperpop, rage, trap, and EDM that surprises at every turn - and after every subsequent listen.</p>
<p>That being said, while <em>Revengeseekers</em> does often feel like chaos, Jane Remover is certainly in control of what’s happening at every turn. Tracks like “JRJRJR” are full of old samples of their old music for fans to unpack, and there are also surprise guitars on “Fadeoutz,” choirs on “angels in camo,” and harmonicas on “Dreamflashers.” Truly, there are surprises at every point when you’re willing to peel back some of this album’s hooks and layers. On other tracks, though, like the frenetic Danny Brown-featured “Psychoboost,” it’s best to just let yourself be taken away by the mayhem.</p>
<p>“JRJRJR” is where everything begins (and ends) with this project. Released on the first day of 2025, the single was full of glitch and braggadocio, not to mention equally catchy and mind-frying. The track sees the artist taunt how they can’t be contained, saying “I might ball out on a new face, change my name, then my city.” Seeing how chameleonic their career and persona has been, it’s easy to believe them, and hard not to embark on their experimental victory lap with them.</p>
