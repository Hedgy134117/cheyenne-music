Every time an artist I like has a 70’s revival album I always think to myself… is this peak? Is this the best music it’s possible to make? In this case, the answer just might be “yes,” because I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed a King Gizzard album *this* much. Loads of fun from front to back, and possibly the best arrangements on any KG album to date. The title track, “Deadstick,” and “Grow Wings and Fly” alone are all-timers.
