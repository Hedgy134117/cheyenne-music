<h1>Tether by Annahstasia</h1>
<img src="/imgs/Annahstasia-Tether.jpg" />

<p>A completely singular, unforgettable debut effort. Annahstasia has one of the most distinct voices I have heard in a while - it’s husky, expansive, and incredibly emotive. On this record, she manages to craft acoustic arrangements that suit her vocals perfectly. These instrumentals are highly naturalistic, but still feel detailed, flowing and swelling beautifully while still allowing Annahstasia’s vocals to completely hold the foreground.</p>
<p>All the while, Annahstasia tells many intimate tales, often with uncertain relationships in mind. On “Unrest,” she experiences bliss with her partner, but is plagued by doubt. “Be Kind” beautifully unpacks both the difficulty and happy anticipation of being vulnerable with someone, and putting your best foot forward even though you “never learned/To be kind.” However, the album’s biggest standout comes with the closer “Believer,” with its emotional and instrumental swells as she confronts a lover. This track also features one of Annahstasia’s most arresting vocal performances, making it truly an emotional peak. After such an intricately crafted debut, I am beyond excited to see where Annahstasia goes next.</p>
