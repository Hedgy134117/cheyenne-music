Between this one and another record later in the top 5, 2025 has been a great year for Baltimore. On this record, my first exposure to both Infinity Knives (producer) and Brian Ennals (rapper), the duo slid seamlessly between different styles and headspaces to make a truly holistic, awestriking hip hop experience.  

<!-- excerpt -->

Truth be told, I almost did not include this in my final top 50 because it came out around the time when I was nose-deep in finals in the Spring. I discovered it through a Fantano review, listened to it, absolutely loved it, listened to it again, and then forgot about it until today (12/23). I am so endlessly glad I got my bearings and remembered how much I love this album so I can put it in my top 5 of 2025, exactly where it belongs.  

The opening track, “The Iron Wall,” plunges the listener into scathing experimental hip hop, in such a way that everyone from Netanyahu and the IDF, to Donald Trump and the CIA, to Gal Gadot catches strays. Elsewhere, “Live at the Chinese Buffet” is a track full of atmosphere and critiques of the hip hop sphere, and “Trevoga” and “Sometimes, Papi Chulo” see Infinity Knives toy with gorgeous Russian folk and salsa, respectively. All the while, they enlist a host of talented features \- including talented vocalists like FRANKI3, Vladena Volodkevich, and Gabriela Bibiana that really sell the different styles that the duo are trying to push forward. The fact that these two managed to pull off such a wide array of styles is one thing, but it’s the fact that they manage to coexist so well in this duo’s record that blows my mind.  

I also appreciate the persona that Brian Ennals constructs as a rapper throughout this record. Based on his views and the people he calls out, it’s obvious that he’s a humanitarian who wants better for the world. However, he equally seems to feel that he has nothing to lose, having no qualms about calling out what he sees in both our world leaders and the music industry. In music, there will always be value in genuineness and truth-telling, and it’s always refreshing to hear people say whatever the hell they want in such an inventive way.
