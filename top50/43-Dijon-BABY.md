A maximal and collage-like record that combines the soulfulness of 90’s-2000’s silk-shirt R\&B with restless experimentation in a similar vein to his colleague, mk.gee. As a result, it stutters and bursts with emotion and vibrance, producing moments that can be relentlessly funky and full of pop shimmer \- in a way, like a 21st century Prince. The whole project is stellar, but “Yamaha” in particular is a tune that I would love to shout from the rooftops.
