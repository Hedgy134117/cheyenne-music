If I had more sway in this world, U.S. Girls and Meg Remy generally would be globally revered as one of the best pop acts working today. No matter how I feel about the overall experience of some of their records, they always put out at least one track that completely blows me away. For 2025’s *Scratch It,* that track was “Like James Said” \- a prog-pop homage to James Brown whose character has “felt low for so long now, I’m ready for a change,” and invokes the power of dancing alone to feel better. There is also a great guitar solo on the back end of the track, and some dramatic string motifs that raise the stakes. A fantastic, fun, and true song in a discography full of them\!
