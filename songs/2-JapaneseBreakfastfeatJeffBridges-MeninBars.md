Those of us who were privy to Michelle’s “pop songs 2020” EP with Ryan Galloway did a double take when the first verse of “Men in Bars” hit\! This song is a revisitation and dressing up of the austere, demo-like “Ballad 0” that closed out that EP, and it makes for one of Zauner’s best songs. The dreamy, pensive melody works so well in the context of a country ballad, and I love the melancholic vibe that Jeff Bridges brings with his more gruff, Nick Cave-esque vocal. The lyrics are also fantastic: aided by the duet format, the dynamic between a man who is stuck in cycles of “tumbling down” before “finding his head again” and a woman who lapses in her faith due to frustration, is clearer than ever. The reminiscing between the characters and their commitment to staying together makes this track feel like a particularly mature take on this type of conflict in a long-term relationship. A good reminder of the magic Zauner evokes through her songwriting, in this case just by capturing a mundanely troubled relationship with so much perspective and empathy.
