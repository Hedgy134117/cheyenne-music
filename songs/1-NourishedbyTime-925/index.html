    <div class="review">
        <p>In 6 years of making end-of-year music lists, 2025 is the very first time that my favorite song of the year was from my favorite album of the year. In this case, there wasn’t any need for a second thought - no album gave me as much hope and excitement this year as <em>The Passionate Ones,</em> and “9 2 5” is the epitome of what makes the record work so well: from its bright piano keys to its energetic Baltimore club feel, to the story it tells. It also almost feels like the mission statement of NBT’s vision and philosophy.</p>
<p>“9 2 5” is Brown’s answer to the notion of the “starving artist,” a notion that has long seemed to rationalize the poverty afflicting many creatives, and the lack of legitimacy their careers are given. In reality, though, most creatives cannot afford to waste away in the name of their work. The “starving artist” is really the hustler we see in “9 2 5,” who “works restaurants by day and writes love songs every night” to see his dreams through. He isn’t sober, he’s always working, and he’s barely making it by, but he is doing what he can to realize his vision, and refuses to let his spirit be crushed by the oppressive force of capitalism.</p>
<p>On “9 2 5,” Brown really defines what it means to be one of the “Passionate Ones” that his record calls to. Going beyond the narrative the song provides, the second verse reassures that “you won’t always be here to be tricked and lied to,” and calls us to “always have a fight” in the face of “sedatives and passing time.” Being passionate is more than being romantic or idealistic - it is an imperative, and a logical response to the media pushing us to be more and more nihilistic. Just as we need to protect our passion to be creative, we must also protect our passion for our neighbors, and for victims of atrocity globally - whether we participate in the “9 2 5” hellscape or not.</p>
