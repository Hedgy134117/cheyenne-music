Does everything that this band touches turn to gold? Out of any track on Swans’ larger-than-life *Birthing,* “The Merge” is definitely evidence in their favor. Part sound collage, part swirling free jazz, part neo-folk, “The Merge” feels like a sonic rebirth and might be one of the most staggering pieces in their recent catalog.
