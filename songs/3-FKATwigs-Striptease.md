I still remember my first time listening to *EUSEXUA,* not knowing how things could get better as I got to the latter songs in the track list (aside from not being into “Childlike Things,”) and promptly having my mind completely blown by “Striptease.” Just the lilting, minor-key melody of the verses alone is so alluring, and sounds so bizarre for a pop song, that it’s hard to forget about the track once you hear it for the first time. Then, after the majority of the song’s trap-influenced sound, Twigs goes full ethereal club-mode for the coda, even throwing in one of the most dramatic vocal motifs of her career on the back end of the track \- sounding a little bit like an operatic Dolores O’Riordan. All the while, she compares the act of becoming known by another person to the revealing, but calculated movements of a striptease. Like many great Twigs tracks, it’s equally sensual and ethereal, while combining sounds and styles that feel ancient, visceral, and cutting-edge.
