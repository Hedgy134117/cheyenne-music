On this year’s best protest song, Fiona Apple draws from her 2 years of experience as a court watcher in Maryland to sharply condemn the U.S. Cash-Bail system. Even when presumed innocent, people can be jailed pre-trial and cannot leave if they are unable to afford bail, which can devastate families as outlined in this song. Musically, Apple continues exploring the percussive, but austere arrangements that made 2020’s *Fetch the Bolt Cutters* so provocative.
