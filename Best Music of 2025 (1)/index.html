<p>The Passionate Ones, by Nourished by Time</p>
<p>An AOTY for Nourished By Time has been years in the making: in 2023, I absolutely loved Erotic Probiotic 2, along with last year’s Catching Chickens EP. Marcus Brown has an undeniably wistful, emotive voice, which helps him to really sell his songs about love and labor under capitalism. On <em>The Passionate Ones,</em> Brown’s pop sensibility comes to the forefront, and the result is his most immediate set of songs yet, and a jarringly perfect pop album for our times<br>
Brown sure can build a track - his penchant for layers on <em>The Passionate Ones</em> is part of what gives its songs their perfect sense of timing. “BABY BABY” is a perfect example of this: its stark, blown-out vocal layers at the intro eventually build into a bombastic synth swell during iterations of the chorus. Other notable moments include the gorgeous sample used in the chorus of “Max Potential,” an ode to love in a capitalist hellscape (“if I’m gonna go insane/At least I’m loved by you”); and just the entirety of “9 2 5:” an addictive dancefloor number about a character who tries to play the system (and stay alive) by writing love songs after shifts at his restaurant day job.<br>
Singles aside, the song that really led me to consider this album for AOTY is actually the second track, “Idiot in the Park.” In an album full of earnest songs about protecting your humanity (and passion), “Idiot in the Park” takes a much more absurd approach by writing about an interaction between the narrator and a psychic in the park, who “says she knows what Jesus knows.” There’s a lot of humor in the song, with Brown complaining, “she’s giving me the runaround,” and “she didn’t ever read my palms, so I know she’s gonna get me wrong.” But with that, the narrator also finds meaning in interacting with this “Idiot in the Park,” when “she says she knows I lost a friend,” and “she made me laugh, she made me cry.” The song becomes incredibly affecting, and maybe says a bit about what you can get out of spontaneous interactions in your community, and especially in the age of stranger danger.<br>
It is my utmost belief that the type of omnivorous R&amp;B and powerful messaging that Brown is giving us as Nourished By Time is vitally important. It takes a lot of courage and energy to preserve your love and humanity while the world is unravelling, but <em>maybe</em> it can be done, and <em>maybe</em> we can fight for ourselves and others in the meantime. Earworm choruses and genre concoctions aside, rising above despair is the message that Marcus Brown delivers in this album, and it is one that I will try my hardest to take with me into 2026.</p>

<p>Eusexua, by FKA Twigs</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Eusexua as an era: the original album tracklist, along with the second version and the <em>Afterglow</em> record, has been the single best musical moment of 2025. This album stayed with me throughout the entire year - I was enamoured with the original the moment it came out, and its highlights (the title track, “Room of Fools,” “Keep It, Hold it,” and ESPECIALLY “Striptease”) soundtracked my entire year, from start to finish.<br>
There were hangups, though. For one, I hated “Childlike Things” and wasn’t that sold on “Perfect Stranger” either. Then, November came… and she released another version of Eusexua that happened to replace a few tracks I wasn’t sold on with new tracks that were absolutely perfect (I especially loved “Perfectly”). Is this cheating??? Who’s to say - regardless, by the time I was making this list, I could not deny the fact that Eusexua belonged in the top 3.<br>
I have been a fan of FKA Twigs since around 2018, and witnessing the release of this album as a long-time fan was nothing short of sublime. With the precise emotions it captures in its lyrics, its euphoric sonic experiments, and perhaps most importantly, Twigs’ vocals sounding as free and unbridled as they’ve ever sounded (especially recalling the climax of “Striptease” and just the entirety of “Room of Fools”) - Eusexua truly feels like Twigs’ most raw musical statement. As I listen to it, I can’t help but feel that this is exactly the sort of sound and message she has spent years working towards - it’s incredible to see her reach this point in her career.<br>
When promoting this album, I remember seeing FKA Twigs talk about the profound healing that she was able to do while regularly raving in Prague, and how that inspired Eusexua. Throughout the record, she evokes a number of emotions - from going out and feeling yourself (“Girl Feels Good,” “Drums of Death”), to wrestling with your demons (“Keep It, Hold It”), to attempting at intimacy/vulnerability (“Sticky,” “Eusexua”). At its core, Eusexua is about going out and melding with others who are also wrestling with something - encapsulated by “We build something together,” as she says on “Room of Fools.” The record is a reminder that healing can come from unexpected places, and sometimes, just going out and experiencing other people can help.</p>

<p>hexed!, by aya</p>
<p>For most of the 2020s so far, most of the most acclaimed acts and records are the ones that successfully harness and replicate the energy of a bygone era - from the pandemic-era disco craze to the 90s fascination in indie rock, all of us seem to be craving an escape to an era that is less humiliating than our own. It’s easy to get bored of nostalgia, which is why I find it so exciting when I find an album by an artist who seems to be doing something completely fresh and different. This year, that album for me was <em>hexed!,</em> by aya.<br>
aya snuck onto the experimental electronic scene in 2021 with <em>im hole</em> - a record that I found particularly isolating and memorable with its psychedelic intensity and slow, amorphous pace. While that album offered a particularly decided sense of identity, <em>hexed!</em> benefits from a bit more structure, and there’s newfound accessibility in a lot of these track with club-ready beats and menacing, but sticky hooks (see “off to the ESSO,” “the names of f***** chav boys,” “droplets,” and “navel glazer”).<br>
Across the record, <em>hexed!</em> blisters with the pain of survivorship - inspired by aya’s own chastisement from growing up queer, as well as her experiences with getting sober. The lyrics are dark and scathing, with aya’s own vocal delivery ranging from chanting, to screaming, to whispering. Some lyrics express a desire for oblivion (“No more gravity/no more inertia/heat death/everything stop”), others explore nightmares through images like “vulpine features strangled with a power cord.” There are also lyrics that really powerfully capture the feeling of being “stuck” in your own trauma while the world keeps moving around you, (particularly, “I used to say some shit about a stopped clock/As the time slipped right off my hands,” which is one of my favorite bars on the album).<br>
All the while, her voice seems to be at war with the abrasive instrumentals supporting her - for example, in “heat death,” the lyrics are punctuated by 8-bit “bleeps” while a deep, industrial bassline bubbles beneath. The soundscapes are turbulent, feeling like they could explode at any moment - and when they do, they produce moments that are equally terrifying and cathartic. Amidst all of the terror on this album, whenever I returned to it, I couldn’t help but feel like everything that was going on just sounded really <em>cool</em> - it’s obvious that a lot of care went into concocting a soundscape this unhinged, and aya’s efforts were successful by all means.</p>

<p>Revengeseekerz, by Jane Remover</p>
<p>The fact that Jane Remover is one of the most recognizable names in experimental music merely 3 albums into their career is known by nearly everyone at this point. However, until <em>Revengeseekerz</em> came out this Spring, I don’t know if any of us knew they could rage <em>this</em> hard. Largely leaving behind the shoegaze-y sound of 2023’s <em>Census Designated, Revengeseekerz</em> sees the artist fully embrace rage, while giving it a spin that only they could give it.<br>
“Overload” doesn’t even begin to describe what’s happening here - the tracks on <em>Revengeseekers</em> feel like they’re bursting at the seams with trap beats, bitcrushed synths, record scratches, samples, and whatever else Jane felt could fit into the mix. The result is an amalgam of hyperpop, rage, trap, and EDM that surprises at every turn - and after every subsequent listen.<br>
That being said, while <em>Revengeseekers</em> does often feel like chaos, Jane Remover is certainly in control of what’s happening at every turn. Tracks like “JRJRJR” are full of old samples of their old music for fans to unpack, and there are also surprise guitars on “Fadeoutz,” choirs on “angels in camo,” and harmonicas on “Dreamflashers.” Truly, there are surprises at every point when you’re willing to peel back some of this album’s hooks and layers. On other tracks, though, like the frenetic Danny Brown-featured “Psychoboost,” it’s best to just let yourself be taken away by the mayhem.<br>
“JRJRJR” is where everything begins (and ends) with this project. Released on the first day of 2025, the single was full of glitch and braggadocio, not to mention equally catchy and mind-frying. The track sees the artist taunt how they can’t be contained, saying “I might ball out on a new face, change my name, then my city.” Seeing how chameleonic their career and persona has been, it’s easy to believe them, and hard not to embark on their experimental victory lap with them.</p>

<p>A City Drowned in God’s Black Tears, by Infinity Knives &amp; Brian Ennals</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Between this one and another record later in the top 5, 2025 has been a great year for Baltimore. On this record, my first exposure to both Infinity Knives (producer) and Brian Ennals (rapper), the duo slid seamlessly between different styles and headspaces to make a truly holistic, awestriking hip hop experience.<br>
Truth be told, I almost did not include this in my final top 50 because it came out around the time when I was nose-deep in finals in the Spring. I discovered it through a Fantano review, listened to it, absolutely loved it, listened to it again, and then forgot about it until today (12/23). I am so endlessly glad I got my bearings and remembered how much I love this album so I can put it in my top 5 of 2025, exactly where it belongs.<br>
The opening track, “The Iron Wall,” plunges the listener into scathing experimental hip hop, in such a way that everyone from Netanyahu and the IDF, to Donald Trump and the CIA, to Gal Gadot catches strays. Elsewhere, “Live at the Chinese Buffet” is a track full of atmosphere and critiques of the hip hop sphere, and “Trevoga” and “Sometimes, Papi Chulo” see Infinity Knives toy with gorgeous Russian folk and salsa, respectively. All the while, they enlist a host of talented features - including talented vocalists like FRANKI3, Vladena Volodkevich, and Gabriela Bibiana that really sell the different styles that the duo are trying to push forward. The fact that these two managed to pull off such a wide array of styles is one thing, but it’s the fact that they manage to coexist so well in this duo’s record that blows my mind.<br>
I also appreciate the persona that Brian Ennals constructs as a rapper throughout this record. Based on his views and the people he calls out, it’s obvious that he’s a humanitarian who wants better for the world. However, he equally seems to feel that he has nothing to lose, having no qualms about calling out what he sees in both our world leaders and the music industry. In music, there will always be value in genuineness and truth-telling, and it’s always refreshing to hear people say whatever the hell they want in such an inventive way.</p>

<p>Getting Killed, by Geese</p>
<p>2025 may have been the year of good sophomore releases - if I’m not mistaken, they make up about half of my top 10! But the fact that Geese spiritually (if not literally) had <em>the</em> sophomore album of 2025 is not lost on anyone. After bursting onto the scene in 2023 with their breakout effort <em>3D Country</em>, raising rumors that they were going to bring back “real” rock ‘n’ roll, <em>Getting Killed</em> saw them explode to legendary proportions in one of the most universal and well-deserved hype trains of recent memory.<br>
<em>Getting Killed</em> actually sees Geese leave behind some of what made them popular with <em>3D Country.</em> Where the latter shone with memorable singalong choruses and focused genre studies, <em>Getting Killed</em> has a sound that can go to some extreme depths. Cameron Winter, continuing down the vocal path he explored on his late 2024 singer-songwriter record, wails emotively on this project - landing somewhere between the soulful wiles of Tim Buckley and the desperation of Lou Reed. The wild choirs of the title track feel cultish, and the “chorus” of opener “Trinidad” blisters and explodes as Winter screams “THERE’S A BOMB IN MY CAR.” There’s also a sort of unspoken darkness to how Geese approach their grooves: on a lot of these tracks (eg. “100 Horses”), there aren’t many huge left turns going on in the rhythm section, but the shifting dynamics and intensity create a chugging, krautrock-adjacent vibe that feels equally jammy, earthy, and dark.<br>
But, as Geese fans know, these songs are also endlessly beautiful and irresistible. There’s the swaggering and sweet “Baby”-punctuated chorus of “Cobra,” the twinkling guitars and piano of “Au Pays du Cocaine,” and the pop rock melody of “Taxes” that comes to build so much catharsis, just to name a few. The latter of those also offers one of the most affecting and relatable American political sentiments of the year, as Cameron sings about how “I [we] should burn in hell” for the atrocities committed by the United States using our tax money, going on to say that he would rather die than pay his taxes. Another climax of the record is the closer “Long Island City Here I Come,” which deals in fast-paced, frenetic grooves and incredible one-liners like “Like Joshua kicked the king out of Jericho/I'm about to kick your ass up and down this street,” and “The lord has a lot of friends, and in the end/He'll probably forget he's ever met you before.” With so much energy and catharsis, <em>Getting Killed</em> certainly holds as the most refreshing rock album of the year.</p>

<p>Portrait of my Heart, by SPELLLING</p>
<p>For many people who follow music even a little closely, the release of <em>The Turning Wheel</em> in the Summer of 2021 was a pretty rapturous moment. Equally symphonic and mysterious, it was a record full of meticulously crafted arrangements, lyrics that were both whimsical and revealing, and Chrystia Cabral’s emotive, distinct voice. Additionally, the record had the most complex and rewarding melodies I had heard in pop music in a long while - see the chameleonic and genius chorus of opener “Little Deer.” So… what does one do after making such a painstakingly gorgeous, and unfathomably difficult-to-make album?<br>
In <em>Portrait of my Heart’s</em> case, the answer seems to be simply letting loose a little bit. This time around, Cabral went in an alt-rock direction without compromising any of her distinct, witchy vibe or melodic prowess, and the results are fantastic - and <em>so</em> much fun. The cool symphonic arrangements and synth-work are still there in spades (“Destiny Arrives”!!!!!!), but are now accompanied by energetic underlying rock instrumentation, which works in Cabral’s favor to bring some propulsion to her sound. The result is somewhere between 90’s grunge, pop-punk, nu metal, and Disney channel rock - and is a fusion that is ever so close to my heart.<br>
I think that a lot of the charm of this album just comes with how much earnestness Cabral approaches this project with. She wears her influences on her sleeve a bit by bravely covering My Bloody Valentine’s “Sometimes” (and doing a great job with it!). Across the project, her passionate vocals on the choruses of tracks like “Alibi” and “Love Ray Eyes” elevate them to heroic proportions and save them from flaccid nostalgia. As she navigates “love, intimacy, anxiety, and alienation,” in her words, her earnest delivery of these emotions makes you feel like you’re right there with her - being a wide-eyed spectator and subject of these grandiose, universal feelings. It may be a more visceral, low-hanging fruit than <em>The Turning Wheel,</em> and it could just be the same emotional tricks that have been played on us by notorious pop-rock feeling-feelers like Paramore and Alanis Morissette for decades - but it really does feel so right, both then and now.</p>

<p>Big City Life, by SMERZ</p>
<p>Great music. Deliriously lobotomized. “My IQ low and my shoe heels high.” But also… it’s so hypnotic? So psychedelic? I could melt into the shuffling, trip hop-flavored backing track of “But I do” for hours. Not a single track feels long enough, including the 5-minute “You got time and I got money.” That being said, I find it difficult to write about why this album works so well, because a lot of the appeal is just the vibe it exudes, making it feel immune to intellectualization.<br>
It could all boil down to the instrumental decisions that this album makes. While being pretty minimal on the surface, a lot of the smaller details are very odd and surprising, but work perfectly. The somewhat dissonant string pizzicato of “Feisty” is a great example of that - it shouldn’t belong on a pop track, but also feels right at home here. The duo take a deadpan, somewhat wry approach to their vocal delivery (there’s definitely a hint of Coco &amp; Clair Clair in there), and their lyrics are often nonsensical, giving the project a lot of humor. However, just when you start to get adjusted to the duo’s ironic tone, moments of awestriking beauty sneak up on you. The understated vocals and plucked instrumentation of “A thousand lies,” for example, are an absolutely gorgeous combination and make for the album’s most dreamlike track.<br>
That being said, the song that really sells <em>Big City Life,</em> and the one on everyone’s minds, is the slow-burn love song “You got time and I got money.” There’s an analog ambience to the drums and bassline of this song that creates a gorgeous atmosphere along with the strings and hummed refrains. Again, the lyrics on this song can be bizarre at points, but sometimes they’re so earnest that they really work, even when straddling the romance of the song with the group’s inherent humor and irreverence (“Baby, can I see you naked? (please)/Even though I love how you dress”). While this track is certainly unique in the scheme of the album, it also epitomizes the balancing act the duo does that makes <em>Big City Life</em> so great: it feels both introverted and undeniably pop, both highbrow and lowbrow, and both silly and transcendental.</p>

<p>Pirouette, by Model/Actriz</p>
<p>Pop music can be a complicated medium for queerness. Particularly since we presently seem to be undergoing a conservative regression - there is a very loud vacancy of queer artists who are both high profile and universally respected. In particular, Sam Smith and Lil Nas X have seen pretty significant declines in popularity. And all the while, a Mormon kid named Benson Boone is doing backflips in skintight, sparkly jumpsuits. Now, more than ever, queerness catapults straight, boring artists into superstardoms while actual queer artists struggle to reach an audience, and are sequestered to alternative spaces.<br>
Despite all of this, Model/Actriz followed up their incredibly dark, unnerving, no-wave-inflected debut <em>Dogsbody</em> with <em>Pirouette:</em> a sophomore effort that often feels a bit like a pop album. From the start with the falsetto hook of “Vespers,” Cole Haden approaches popstar sensibility a la Circus-era Britney with genre-melding confidence as he straddles industrial/no-wave music and German techno. The sound is simultaneously anxious and club-ready, producing moments like “Diva” whose spoken verses ooze with swagger, but also like “Acid Rain,” whose soft instrumentation and gentle melodies bizarrely harken to Y2K adult pop (the vibe of Tori Amos’ “A Sorta Fairytale” comes to mind).<br>
An important difference between <em>Dogsbody</em> and <em>Pirouette</em> comes when considering how each of them approach discussing queerness. Where <em>Dogsbody</em> was rapt with hedonism, shame, and overt sexuality, <em>Pirouette</em> takes more of a self-possessed and unpacked approach. Some tracks, like closer “Baton,” are more about how vulnerable it feels to be perceived by others when, for example, they remember something about you that you forgot. In “Diva,” Haden meets other gay men in Europe with the obstacle of having nowhere to take them home (“No home to take you home to”), showing the intersection of loneliness and scarcity. In “Cinderella,” Haden recalls wanting a Cinderella birthday party when he was five but not asking for one because of a conscious fear of betrayal and abandonment. Thus, <em>Pirouette</em> comes as a poignant and thoughtful release, without sacrificing the band’s intrigue and experimentation.</p>

<p>I Love My Computer, by Ninajirachi</p>
<p>2025 was an awful year to be online, and was a year where just existing on Instagram left me feeling so depressed that I eventually decided to (gradually) cut it out of my life. Even still, I felt like the very problems I thought I was avoiding by being offline were infiltrating my life as a university student - as a professor encouraged AI-editing for my senior capstone paper that I spent the entirety of the semester poring over. Further, a doomsday mentality loomed over my graduation ceremony last week, as all of us were aware that, to varying extents, we worked for degrees that may come to nothing. With this backdrop, I find it surprising how easily I swallowed the techno-optimism (or at least, observationalism) of <em>I Love My Computer.</em> But - it seems to me that Ninajirachi’s love letter to EDM and computers came at the perfect time.<br>
This record makes the case for being raised on the internet not being <em>that</em> bad, without shying away from the dangers we all had to contend with. “iPod Touch” chronicles teen girlhood as it played out in the 2010s, and shows how being online wasn’t necessarily at odds with adolescence in the real world. The internet could bring you music that colored your childhood memories of going to the beach or the mall. “Fuck My Computer” is a hypnotic dubstep rager that’s about exactly what it says, delivered with an ironic and deadpan tone. Later, “CSIRAC” and “Infohazard” observe the darker corners of the internet, with the latter narrating the accidental finding of a snuff film online at too young of an age. “Delete” is about the phenomenon of posting and deleting thirst traps, and shows ambiguity about <em>who</em> these thirst traps are for - it could be Nina herself, or a crush who might see it in time, or it might just be her computer.<br>
Sonically, this album uniquely has nostalgia for 2010s EDM (particularly the Porter Robinson side of things) and dubstep, along with electroclash and hyperpop. I never thought that I had nostalgia for this specific genre or vibe, but the more colorful EDM-tinged tracks on this album evoke such specific and visual images for me - like scrolling through the original girlsgogames homepage before websites all became minimal/homogenized later in the 2010s. Occasionally, I am reminded of how real 2010s nostalgia is when I hear “Clarity” by Zedd in public and get the urge to sing along as dramatically as I can - a sentiment that I suspect Ninajirachi might share. Ultimately, there isn’t anything we can do to reverse the horrific changes that have been done to the internet, but I like the healthy mindset <em>I Love My Computer</em> puts forth in processing Gen Z chronic online-ness and maladaptive nostalgia, and I equally love the sonic jolt it gives me when I listen to it.</p>

<p>Lotus, by Little Simz</p>
<p><em>Lotus</em> was a unique listening experience for me this year because I both loved it immediately and took time to realize just how fantastic it was. Simz has been in an interesting position career-wise since <em>Sometimes I Might Be Introvert</em> because, while being inarguably on a victory lap, she has not fully attempted to re-capture that particular album’s symphonic, larger-than-life magic. In <em>Lotus’</em> case, the rapper creates an array of moments that approach career-defining grandiosity, but in a way that feels fresh and unique.<br>
A lot of the tracks on <em>Lotus</em> are flavored with rock and jazz, as well as the Afrobeat influences she had been exploring prior in her career. This relatively new and invigorated sound produces moments that are incredibly energetic (“Thief”), funky (“Enough”), and a lot of fun (“Young”). That being said, though, <em>Lotus</em> counterbalances this fun and energy with a lot of probing into Little Simz’s relationships with others - whether she’s calling out those who have used or wronged her like on the opener “Thief,” or deeply interrogating familial relationships as in the vulnerable track “Blood.” After many replays, I’ve come to the conclusion that <em>Lotus</em>, with the varied sonic and emotional experiences it provides, is one of the most rewarding records of the year - and in Simz’ discography.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tether, by Annahstasia</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A completely singular, unforgettable debut effort. Annahstasia has one of the most distinct voices I have heard in a while - it’s husky, expansive, and incredibly emotive. On this record, she manages to craft acoustic arrangements that suit her vocals perfectly. These instrumentals are highly naturalistic, but still feel detailed, flowing and swelling beautifully while still allowing Annahstasia’s vocals to completely hold the foreground.<br>
All the while, Annahstasia tells many intimate tales, often with uncertain relationships in mind. On “Unrest,” she experiences bliss with her partner, but is plagued by doubt. “Be Kind” beautifully unpacks both the difficulty and happy anticipation of being vulnerable with someone, and putting your best foot forward even though you “never learned/To be kind.” However, the album’s biggest standout comes with the closer “Believer,” with its emotional and instrumental swells as she confronts a lover. This track also features one of Annahstasia’s most arresting vocal performances, making it truly an emotional peak. After such an intricately crafted debut, I am beyond excited to see where Annahstasia goes next.</p>

<p>All Cylinders, by Yves Jarvis</p>
<p>In my mind, Yves Jarvis has always occupied a very frenetic, “jack-of-all trades” place in experimental/indie music. He has such a knack for melody, and his whimsical sense of song structure tends to tease the listener with a great motif or melody before jumping to the next idea. Contrastingly, <em>All Cylinders</em> shows Yves Jarvis in a place of unparalleled concentration. The results are an absolute delight to the ear from front to back, as the psychedelic musician lets ideas linger for a bit longer and develop into fantastic, nostalgic tracks.<br>
Yves Jarvis’ influences range far and wide on this project. The bombastic opener “With A Grain” equally recalls 60’s chamber pop and the more recent indie icon St. Vincent with its playful, slinking guitar passages. This is followed by “Gold Filigree” which is a fantastic exercise in early 70’s R&amp;B/soul slow jams, and “One Gripe,” which is full of pop shimmer and has some of the stickiest melodies on the album. Despite his omnivorous influences on <em>All Cylinder</em>, Yves concocts a sound that feels refreshing, and completely his own - one dream-like track at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fancy That, by PinkPantheress</p>
<p>In an ideal world, this would have been the biggest album of the year. Incredible tunes and remixes (the Nia Archives remix of Illegal???), great music videos, and that iconic Tiny Desk performance… As far as I’m concerned, 2025 has been her year. While I would love to see PinkPantheress try doing a longer record at some point, it is honestly impressive how much heat she manages to pack into this record’s 20 minute runtime - “Illegal,” “Tonight,” and “Stateside” alone are some of the best songs she’s ever put out.<br>
Part of the triumph of <em>Fancy That</em> is how it both retains and in some ways surpasses the homegrown vibe of PinkPantheress’ prior work. Her sound, especially on opener “Illegal,” is still very nocturnal and retains her UK garage and jungle influences, as well as her sense of emo nostalgia. However, I don’t think her music has ever sounded as club-ready as it does on “Stateside,” and as a whole, <em>Fancy That</em> is the most open about desire and sexuality that PinkPantheress has been in her career. Altogether, this was a really great, very hypnotic pop record, and represents an exciting leap in PinkPantheress’ career.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DÍA, by Ela Minus</p>
<p>Another record that speaks to the healing and introspective power of electronic music. <em>DÍA</em> came after a time of personal strife and uncertainty for Ela Minus after relocating during the pandemic, which is also when she began gaining traction for her debut record <em>acts of rebellion.</em> On this night-veiled follow-up, Ela looks inward while making her sound even more expansive (think Kelly Lee Owens). While hitting energetic highs, <em>DÍA</em> also rewards patient listeners with its meditative pacing - for example, during the openers “ABRIR MONTE” and “BROKEN.” The former begins with a deep, two-chord synth that lingers throughout the latter, even when the anthemic chorus is introduced and bursts with melody and color.<br>
The attitude of this album is world-weary, but mostly optimistic. On “BROKEN,” she sings “I’ll keep writing melodies/To sing away the gloom/That we have succumbed to.” “QQQ” is another highlight on the record - its arpeggiated synths and rhythmic drum patterns make it feel anthemic. However, the lyrics reveal Ela’s apocalyptic emotions as she sings in Spanish, “If it’s going to be like this/Let the world end.” Her sentiments speak to the experience of attempting to heal and do better while the world seems to be slowly ending, and <em>DÍA</em> as a whole is a powerful attempt to reconcile these emotions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Antigone, by Eiko Ishibashi</p>
<p>A lush, mythical, and quietly apocalyptic album, with boundless details to unpack. Truth be told, some of the best orchestration of 2025 can be found on this album - the way she layers her vocals with recordings of traffic instructions and twisted synths on opener “October” is genius. There’s a languidity and warmth to the music that calls to mind mid-70’s Joni Mitchell when she began to experiment with jazz - with occasional interjections from Americana, such as the pedal steel-inspired accordion on “Coma.”<br>
“Mona Lisa” is, lyrically, a very important glimpse into the philosophy of <em>Antigone.</em> It admonishes modern detachment from human suffering, as genocide is “glimpsing through each day.” There is also a lot of disarmingly chilling imagery on many of the tracks, like on Coma (“This is your grid, watched by the security camera/You still have some time/to be a survivor in Eden”) and “October” (“Ashes fall in August/In October, the blood shines”). But all the while, particularly on the jazzier cuts like the title track, Eiko’s presence on the album feels glowing and warm.</p>

<li>
<p>The Distaff, by Maud the Moth</p>
<p>Few things can get me excited about music like a really good new neoclassical darkwave album. Thus, I was elated to discover Maud the Moth and her wonderful record <em>The Distaff</em> back in February. Largely led by Amaya López-Carromero’s powerful vocals and piano playing, <em>The Distaff</em> ebbs and flows between symphonic peaks, and often sounds like pure catharsis.<br>
As the record flows, López-Carromero toys with a lot of different ways to achieve catharsis in different songs. The record has a lot of avant-metal leanings, which produces pummeling heights like that of “A temple by the river.” On “Siphonophores,” metal influence is present in the form of droning, blown-out guitars that sound more indebted to shoegaze. Undoubtedly, though, the nine-minute “Despenaperros” is the centerpiece of <em>The Distaff</em>, featuring slow-moving guitar and orchestral hits and epic choir-led vocals that greatly heighten the drama of the record. Whether she’s dealing in symphonic, metal, or piano-led palettes, <em>The Distaff</em> shows that Maud the Moth is a master of musical tension and release.</p>

<p>Bite Down, by Ribbon Skirt</p>
<p>An often scathing, revealing album that’s host to my favorite indie rock/post punk-y vocal performance of the year, courtesy of Tashiina Buswa. With many tracks inspired by Buswa’s Anishinaabe heritage, she expresses a lot of righteous anguish and rage whether she’s grappling with the weight of marginalized identity, or coping with other daily struggles. Her delivery can be deadpan and almost Valley Girl-adjacent (“Off Rez”), or impassioned and punk-y (the verses of “Wrong Planet”) - but always, Ribbon Skirt feel genuine.<br>
The songwriting on this record is pretty stripped-back, but done incredibly well. “Off Rez” is a particular highlight, as it can be very tongue-in-cheek, criticizing the scandal around Buffy Saint-Marie’s falsified heritage (“They want 2000s Buffy Marie / They want my status, but they’re getting my teeth”) while also earnestly mourning cultural erasure of indigenous people (“I wanna preserve every part that makes me/Not only know but really feel that I’m free”). “Cellophane” is another affecting track that takes a more impressionistic lyrical approach as Buswa describes the grief and shock of losing her grandfather. There are also influences and sounds from across the spectrum of alternative rock on this album - including post punk and shoegaze, which have been done to death by other indie rock groups but feel somehow refreshed in the hands of Ribbon Skirt.</p>

<p>FEMME FATALE, by Mon Laferte</p>
<p>I have to tell you… as far as Spanish-language albums go this year, <em>FEMME FATALE</em> was for me what Rosalia’s <em>LUX</em> seems to be for everyone else. I really adore this. The high-glam vibes are immaculate right off the bat with the title track, as we are immersed in the jazzy throwback vibe of the record. The smoky, nostalgic feel of the record is occasionally disrupted by Laferte’s own idiosyncrasies - such as the autotune-laden vocals on “Mi Hombre” and the bombastic, explosive vocal performance on “Otra Noche de Llorar” (a track that completely warrants any Björk comparisons it elicits).<br>
One of my favorite things about <em>FEMME FATALE</em> is the fact that its penultimate track “My One And Only Love” combines Laferte’s vocal powers with those of two other legendary Latin American singers: Silvana Estrada and Natalia Lafourcade. The song itself is subtle and intimate with an underlying doo-wop rhythm, and it was just incredibly cool to see these three cross paths. Additionally, the other vocal collaborations on the record are also incredible - particularly the Nathy Peluso-featured “La Tirana,” which has an infectious Latin jazz feel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let God Sort Em Out, by Clipse</p>
<p>This one has been done to death in terms of discussion, but I will throw in my two cents by also corroborating that this is a really, really good comeback album. After Clipse’s initial bling-era run, it was difficult to conceptualize how this reunion could go. This became even more true when Pusha T had a career resurgence in the late 2010s. Fortunately, Clipse’s reunion resulted in possibly the most replayable, cinematic, and satisfying hip hop albums of the year - due in large part to the duo’s ability to keep things fresh on the project. Pharell’s production also does a lot of heavy lifting, perfectly complementing the content of the songs themselves.<br>
“Chains &amp; Whips” featuring Kendrick Lamar is a serious highlight of <em>Let God Sort Em Out</em> for me. Obviously, it was just electrifying to see Kendrick in the track list, but the song is also a masterclass in atmosphere-building with a sinister beat and pretty menacing bars from all parties involved. I also really loved the deeply personal angle of tracks like the opener, “The Birds Don’t Sing,” which unpacks and explores grief after the loss of the duo’s parents. Notably, too, “So Be It” has what is probably my favorite beat in any hip hop song this year, as it samples a 1970 track by Saudi composer Talal Maddah. Without a doubt, the highlights of this project come in spades, and I was really excited to see this comeback pan out as well as it did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeking Darkness, by Huremic</p>
<p>After several years of creating some of the best shoegaze in the scene, Parannoul has changed gears significantly to give us <em>Seeking Darkness</em> under his new Huremic project. Divided into five parts, this sprawling record is the artist’s foray into post-rock. Equally psychedelic and aggressive, <em>Seeking Darkness</em> exceeds any expectations, showing once again how visionary of an artist Parannoul is (and in a completely novel way).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hooke’s law, by keiyaA</p>
<p>The best possible way to summarize the overarching theme of this record comes in words that keiyaA penned herself, saying that “a downward spiral is a loaded spring.” After the affirmational air of her debut (2020’s <em>Forever, Ya Girl)</em>, <em>hooke’s law</em> sees keiyaA embrace tension and struggle, and she emerges from the other side intact. Amidst struggles with mental health and love, the production takes on a relaxed, but experimental alternative r&amp;b sound full of crisp beats and spacey synths - with significant influence from IDM and breakbeat. The resulting album is simultaneously wise and relaxed, particularly with keiyaA’s cool melodies drifting woozily on top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>45 Pounds, by YHWH Nailgun</p>
<p>This debut project sees the four-piece, New York-based experimental rock group create tightly organized chaos. With precise, rototom-heavy percussion and noisy, sawing synths and guitar, tracks breeze by with pummeling intensity. The vibe the group creates is equally danceable and ritualistic, and makes for some very exciting experimental rock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noble &amp; Godlike in Ruin, by Deerhoof</p>
<p>On their 20th studio album, the experimental rock veterans take inspiration from Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” to stitch together maximalist, dense compositions. While being as frenetic and raucous as ever, <em>Noble &amp; Godlike in Ruin</em> sees the group approach deeply interesting and existential territory - “Kingtoe” examines our relationships with machines in a very Deefhoofian way (“How can you be so human? / I heard that you were just an animal”). “Immigrant Songs” also delves into what it means to be an immigrant in Trump’s America, while having fantastic experimental passages. Altogether, this record proves that Deerhoof is just as imaginative and exciting as ever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nested in Tangles, by Hannah Frances</p>
<p>In 2024, Hannah Frances’ grief-stricken <em>Keeper of the Shepherd</em> captivated many. This year, she has already blown it out of the water with a record that explores familial trauma and subverts folk tradition. The arrangements are dense and captivating, with touches of free jazz and experimentation coming through that harken to 70’s Joni. That being said, some of the more uncanny vocal layering (mainly on the opening title track) hints at the grandiose art pop of Julia Holter, and there is also plenty of Americana influence that brings a lot of warmth to the mix. The mixture of ideas makes for one of the most captivating singer-songwriter projects of the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magic Alive!, by McKinley Dixon</p>
<p>A colorful, densely orchestrated jazz-rap album that sees McKinley Dixon continue the unbelievable run he has been on since his 2021 breakthrough. It’s an album about death: 3 kids have a friend who passes away, and they grapple with keeping his memory alive by building monuments in his memory, and bargaining to bring him back - eventually reincarnating him on “Sugar Water.” As always, the project is incredibly literary, paying homage to Toni Morrison on tracks like “Recitatif.” The features on the record are also incredibly good - all of the guest verses add a lot to the project, and I especially loved the melodic vocal performances of Anjimile and Shamir.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rock Doido, by Gaby Amarantos</p>
<p>What a trip!!! At 22 songs but only 37 minutes, this album plays out like an assault of nonstop hits that celebrate Brazilian dance music. However, its international influences and callbacks are reminiscent of an M.I.A. record - over the course of the record, there are nods to brega, reggaeton, Brazilian funk, Western popular music, and even Arabian music to some extent on “Short Beira Cu.” Listening to it from start to finish feels like the most fun it’s possible to have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GOLLIWOG, by billy woods</p>
<p>Billy Woods and his career are proof that horrorcore, while known for its shocking and cinematic elements, is also a great medium for retelling terrors of our own history and present. Over sonic backdrops that feel highly dissociative, Woods engages with images like being a vampire’s victim on “Misery,” and amputation on “Maquiladoras,” which he wrote in response to foundational anticolonialist Frantz Fanon. The record is one of his most atmospheric and has some of his most incisive songwriting to date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phantom Island, by King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard</p>
<p>Every time an artist I like has a 70’s revival album I always think to myself… is this peak? Is this the best music it’s possible to make? In this case, the answer just might be “yes,” because I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed a King Gizzard album <em>this</em> much. Loads of fun from front to back, and possibly the best arrangements on any KG album to date. The title track, “Deadstick,” and “Grow Wings and Fly” alone are all-timers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tomorrow We Escape, by HO99O9</p>
<p>A gritty, sharp record that reassures us that punk rap/rap metal doesn’t always have to be a gimmick. On <em>Tomorrow We Escape,</em> the band appear comfortable with exploring all of the extremities of their sound - “Escape” sees them create a pretty overt metal track with a sweeping chorus, and “Incline” (feat. Nova Twins, Pink Siifu &amp; Yung Skrrt) is an electrifying hip hop crossover that combines hardcore hip hop with punk aggression. Elsewhere, “Target Practice” is an industrial-influenced rager that would sound right at home on a NIN record. All in all, this is just absolutely fantastic, and had me feeling very hype every time I listened to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iconoclasts, by Anna von Hausswolff</p>
<p>On a project that feels nearly crushed by its own atmosphere, organist and vocalist Anna von Hausswolff tackles change and renewal. The soundscape she creates on this album is incredible and unique - there’s a presence of saxophone on the album (“The Beast”) that gives it jazz leanings. The heaviness of the organ is also expertly counterbalanced by Anna’s own buoyant vocals, and the two seem to work in perfect synergy. From start to finish, <em>Iconoclasts</em> is a work of truly epic proportions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Spiritual Sound, by Agriculture</p>
<p>A black metal album that rips through many extremes. I wasn’t particularly knowledgeable about all of the black metal albums that were released this year, but this one’s energy and textures caused it to linger with me significantly. With a pummelling and cathartic first side and a slow-burning and spiritual second side, <em>The Spiritual Sound</em> chronicles euphoric rebirth and vibrance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cancionera, by Natalia Lafourcade</p>
<p>Mexican folk singer-songwriter Natalia Lafourcade has basically been on a generational run since the turn of the decade, and <em>Cancionera</em> continues the magic. With the ornate orchestration of her recent records, she has really been able to show off her uncanny sense of timing - letting her compositions breathe when needed, leading to a lot of serene instrumental stretches. It’s all the more impressive that, from what I heard, the songs were recorded in one take! From front to back, a lot of tonal ground is covered - from the lightheartedness of “Cocos en la Playa” to the eeriness of “Luna Cresciente.” This makes <em>Cancionera</em> a pretty varied listen, but make no mistake - all of it is quality!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under Tangled Silence, by Djrum</p>
<p>Just an hour of gorgeous ambient IDM that will stop you in your tracks when you hear it. For an electronic album, though, it features some incredible acoustic orchestration - including spellbinding improvised piano, cello, harp, and mbira over electronic percussion. The overall sound is fluid, sweeping, and trance-like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fairyland Codex, by Tropical Fuck Storm</p>
<p>Easily the darkest and most interesting Tropical Fuck Storm record yet. While tracks like opener “Irukandji Syndrome” see the band elaborate on the noise-punk sound they're known for, the rest of the tracklist goes into deeply interesting territory. I love the Nick Cave-adjacent vibes of “Goon Show,” and the impassioned vocal performances that Fiona and Erica give on later tracks like “Teeth Marché.” Very noisy, proggy, and dark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vanisher, Horizon Scraper, by Quadeca</p>
<p>By far Quadeca’s most ambitious project, and I would say that it was a successful experiment overall. Telling the story of a life using a sea voyage as an extended metaphor, Quadeca uses both overt visuals (via his feature film-length music video for this album) and sonic storytelling to convincingly evoke the ocean. Lots of great tracks that cover everything from folk to chamber pop to experimental rock (courtesy of Maruja), and the storytelling takes on mythical proportions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phonetics On and On, by Horsegirl</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A wiry, infectious record that sees Horsegirl do a lot with a relatively subdued sound. Band members Penelope Lowenstein and Nora Cheng charmingly alternate on vocal duties, giving unpretentious vocal performances that highlight the opacity of their lyrics and the spaciousness of the songs’ mixes. It’s a simple, but refreshing indie rock listen that’s also full of pop appeal and great melodies.</p>
<ol start="38">
<li>
<p>Los Thuthanaka, by Los Thuthanaka</p>
<p>What a wild ride! As acknowledged exhaustively by Pitchfork, <em>Los Thuthanaka</em> exists at a unique and special intersection of a lot of sounds. Specifically, it combines indigenous tradition and digital noise. “Phuju” is a huayño, a festive Andean dance, that is also full of noisy synths and DJ tags. “Apnaqkaya Titi” and “Awila” subvert traditional Bolivian dances with pummelling punk guitars and drums. It is the best and most dizzying kind of fusional, anticolonialist music - and it’s so maximalist that you really have to listen to it yourself to believe what’s happening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cabin in the Sky, by De La Soul</p>
<p>Given the tragic subtext of this record following the passing of Trugoy the Dove, it was difficult to imagine how De La Soul would move forward. <em>Cabin in the Sky</em> sees the group address the loss by celebrating his life, and consequently, the project never feels particularly heavy. There are great features from both legends and newcomers that are transparently and humorously outlined by the album intro. The resulting project is one that manages to entertain the listener as De La Soul always have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hymnal, by Lyra Pramuk</p>
<p>On <em>Hymnal,</em> Pramuk flexes her capability of making expansive, futuristic soundscapes with organic ingredients. There are sweeping, energetic string arrangements and the uncanny patchwork melodies that Pramuk weaves with her own voice. Overall, the sound she creates feels ancient, elemental, and futuristic at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HAGEN, by Titanic</p>
<p>A great release from the Mexico City duo consisting of cellist Mabe Fratti and guitarist Héctor Tosta. As a cellist myself, I have been so excited by Mabe Fratti’s career in particular, and this record was no exception. The cello serves as a grounding, earthy force on this record as the duo make songs that feel expansive and experimental, but still have a surprising degree of infectiousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Laini Tani, by Nadah El Shazly</p>
<p>Following the release of her 2017 debut <em>Ahwar,</em> Cairo-born Nadah El Shazly has expanded her career through film scoring. <em>Laini Tani</em> sees her finally return to recording her own music, and the results are wondrous. Combining Arab classical music melodies with electronics and dream pop, <em>Laini Tani</em> is a lush and expansive listen that almost feels trancelike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BABY, by Dijon</p>
<p>A maximal and collage-like record that combines the soulfulness of 90’s-2000’s silk-shirt R&amp;B with restless experimentation in a similar vein to his colleague, mk.gee. As a result, it stutters and bursts with emotion and vibrance, producing moments that can be relentlessly funky and full of pop shimmer - in a way, like a 21st century Prince. The whole project is stellar, but “Yamaha” in particular is a tune that I would love to shout from the rooftops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alan Sparhawk with Trampled By Turtles, by Alan Sparhawk &amp; Trampled By Turtles</p>
<p>Grief-stricken but hopeful, <em>With Trampled By Turtles</em> is a set of musical gut-punches. The instrumentation provided by bluegrass band Trampled By Turtles is a perfect, warm backdrop for these tracks that see Alan Sparhawk process the loss of his partner, Mimi Parker. It’s gorgeous and vulnerable, truly mining gold from a collaboration that feels unlikely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every Video Without Your Face, Every Sound Without Your Name, by Lucy Liyou</p>
<p>A set of haunting, austere songs led by piano and vocals that interrogates the aftermath of relationships and familial trauma. While making use of space and silence in the recordings to build emotion, many tracks also reach spellbinding peaks through ambient synths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THE BPM, by Sudan Archives</p>
<p>On her expansive follow-up to 2023’s <em>Natural Brown Prom Queen,</em> Sudan Archives continues her relentless musical exploration and pop prowess  as she documents love, ambition, and daily anxieties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Danchi Thesis, by Shinsei Kamattechan</p>
<p>Bursting with frenetic energy, <em>Danchi Thesis</em> is genuinely one of the zaniest records I listened to in 2025, combining high-energy J-rock with indietronica and occasional string arrangements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8 Tips for Catastrophe Living, by Asher White</p>
<p>From post-rock to folk to electronic music, Asher White dabbles in a bit of everything as she processes romantic strife. The results are virtuosic, but have a bit of humor and playfulness as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like a Ribbon, by John Glacier</p>
<p>Amidst her stoic, deadpan rapping style, John Glacier’s debut sees her unflappably tackle a myriad of soundscapes while documenting her own personal and musical growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moneyball, by Dutch Interior</p>
<p>An incredibly warm effort that combines slowcore and Americana to stunning effect. The subdued performances on much of the record allow for its gorgeous textures to shine through.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Honorable mentions:</p>
<p>Endless Bright Horizon, by Juan Berdugo</p>
<p>A gorgeous, expansive art-rock/chamber pop with very deliberate pacing - one of the year’s most contemplative records.</p>
<p>End of the Middle, by Richard Dawson</p>
<p>Perhaps more straightforward and less psychedelic than his other work, <em>End of the Middle</em> is still a thoughtful entry in Dawson’s catalog.</p>
<p>Birthing, by Swans</p>
<p>My favorite band!!! Gira &amp; co. truly do post-rock like no one else, and I was fortunate to see them live (9/5 in Washington D.C.) during this era which was a rapturous experience.</p>
<p>viagr aboys, by Viagra Boys</p>
<p>These freaky ass guys are back at it again! If you liked them before, you’ll probably like them now!</p>
<p>Animaru, by mei semones</p>
<p>A bit of chamber pop, a bit of bossa nova, and a bit of J-pop make for a refreshing, polished album.</p>
<p>Tranquilizer, by Oneohtrix Point Never</p>
<p>On this album, Oneohtrix pulls from commercial sample CDs to make a transient, ethereal album.</p>
<p>A Danger to Ourselves, by Lucrecia Dalt</p>
<p>While presenting very much like a pop album, Lucrecia Dalt concocts a lot of chin-scratching environments here by combining organic and industrial sounds in her instrumentals.</p>
<p>The Film, by Sumac &amp; Moor Mother</p>
<p>Combining Moor Mother’s Afrofuturist insurgency and the larger-than-life physicality of Sumac’s post-metal sound makes for one of 2025’s most apocalyptic listens.</p>
<p>Switcheroo, by Gelli haha</p>
<p>Every time I think I tire of synth-driven indie pop, a fun little catchy release pulls me back in. In this case, it was Gelli haha’s kooky, effervescent alternative dance debut record <em>Switcheroo.</em></p>
<p>In the Blue Light, by Kelela</p>
<p>On the best live album of 2025, Kelela revisits songs across her discography with lush, harp-kissed arrangements.</p>
<p>GUSH, by Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith</p>
<p>Forgoing some of her ambient textures for pulsing, deep basslines and sultry vocals, Smith concocted a record containing some of her most fun and sensual work.</p>
<p>Stardust, by Danny Brown</p>
<p>As explorative as ever, <em>Stardust</em> sees a legend collaborate with some of the most exciting up-and-coming artists/producers in experimental pop to expand his sound.</p>
<p>Sincerely,, by Kali Uchis</p>
<p>This is a great Kali Uchis record, and stands with some of her best work! Just infinitely timeless, gorgeously sung and arranged.</p>
<p>Through the Wall, by Rochelle Jordan</p>
<p>Hypnotic, groovy, and nocturnal - after experimenting with many other electronic subgenres prior to now, <em>Through the Wall</em> sees Jordan embrace the sensual vibe of 90’s house.</p>
<p>A Study of Losses, by Beirut</p>
<p>On this expansive, brilliantly orchestrated album, Beirut chronicles impermanence to moving effect.</p>
<p>Welcome to My Blue Sky, by Momma</p>
<p>A road album that unpacks tales of longing and infidelity amid fuzzy, 90’s-indebted alt-rock.</p>
<p>Bugland, by No Joy</p>
<p>An immersive shoegaze-inspired record that is rife with thick guitars, digital textures and maximalism.</p>
<p>Touch, by Tortoise</p>
<p>With <em>Touch,</em> the post-rock veterans have returned with some of their most cinematic work in years, while keeping the overall sound pretty light.</p>
<p>Vegetables Worldwide, by <a href="http://vgtbl.pl">vgtbl.pl</a></p>
<p>A bold, undeniably fun follow up to the Polish hyperpop duo’s electrifying <em>Komputer</em> EP.</p>
<p>The New Eve Is Rising, by The New Eves</p>
<p>Harkening avant-folk as well as more free form strains of post punk, The New Eves offer a boundary-pushing rebirth of womanhood on this ambitious album.</p>
<p>You’re Weird Now, by Guerilla Toss</p>
<p>On this quirky and well-crafted record, Guerilla Toss is at their most playful and delivers some of their catchiest songs yet (“Psychosis Is Just a Number” and “Life’s a Zoo”).</p>
<p>La Belleza, by Lido Pimienta<br>
For Melancholy Brunettes (&amp; Sad Women), by Japanese Breakfast</p>
<p>Michelle Zauner’s latest country-tinged effort offers some of her strongest orchestration, and both “Men in Bars” and “Winter in L.A.” are some of the best songs she has ever put out.</p>
<p>A Paradise in the Hold, by Yazz Ahmed</p>
<p>A standout jazz album from 2025 that explores the British-Bahraini trumpeter’s cultural identity.</p>
<p>Worldwide, by Snõõper</p>
<p>Sõ glad that Snõõper returned with their sõphõmõre effõrt this year!!! They make egg-punk like nõ õne else can.</p>
<p>I remember I forget, by Yasmine Hamdan</p>
<p>A gorgeous effort that combines Arab music with a number of different styles, from trip hop to ambient music.</p>
<p>DOGA, by Juana Molina</p>
<p>With strangely sticky melodies and eerie ambient electronics, <em>DOGA</em> is a fascinating record - I also am a fan of the album cover!</p>
<p>50 Songs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>9 2 5, by Nourished by Time</p>
<p>In 6 years of making end-of-year music lists, 2025 is the very first time that my favorite song of the year was from my favorite album of the year. In this case, there wasn’t any need for a second thought - no album gave me as much hope and excitement this year as <em>The Passionate Ones,</em> and “9 2 5” is the epitome of what makes the record work so well: from its bright piano keys to its energetic Baltimore club feel, to the story it tells. It also almost feels like the mission statement of NBT’s vision and philosophy.<br>
“9 2 5” is Brown’s answer to the notion of the “starving artist,” a notion that has long seemed to rationalize the poverty afflicting many creatives, and the lack of legitimacy their careers are given. In reality, though, most creatives cannot afford to waste away in the name of their work. The “starving artist” is really the hustler we see in “9 2 5,” who “works restaurants by day and writes love songs every night” to see his dreams through. He isn’t sober, he’s always working, and he’s barely making it by, but he is doing what he can to realize his vision, and refuses to let his spirit be crushed by the oppressive force of capitalism.<br>
On “9 2 5,” Brown really defines what it means to be one of the “Passionate Ones” that his record calls to. Going beyond the narrative the song provides, the second verse reassures that “you won’t always be here to be tricked and lied to,” and calls us to “always have a fight” in the face of “sedatives and passing time.” Being passionate is more than being romantic or idealistic - it is an imperative, and a logical response to the media pushing us to be more and more nihilistic. Just as we need to protect our passion to be creative, we must also protect our passion for our neighbors, and for victims of atrocity globally - whether we participate in the “9 2 5” hellscape or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Men in Bars, by Japanese Breakfast (feat. Jeff Bridges)</p>
<p>Those of us who were privy to Michelle’s “pop songs 2020” EP with Ryan Galloway did a double take when the first verse of “Men in Bars” hit! This song is a revisitation and dressing up of the austere, demo-like “Ballad 0” that closed out that EP, and it makes for one of Zauner’s best songs. The dreamy, pensive melody works so well in the context of a country ballad, and I love the melancholic vibe that Jeff Bridges brings with his more gruff, Nick Cave-esque vocal. The lyrics are also fantastic: aided by the duet format, the dynamic between a man who is stuck in cycles of “tumbling down” before “finding his head again” and a woman who lapses in her faith due to frustration, is clearer than ever. The reminiscing between the characters and their commitment to staying together makes this track feel like a particularly mature take on this type of conflict in a long-term relationship. A good reminder of the magic Zauner evokes through her songwriting, in this case just by capturing a mundanely troubled relationship with so much perspective and empathy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Striptease, by FKA Twigs</p>
<p>I still remember my first time listening to <em>EUSEXUA,</em> not knowing how things could get better as I got to the latter songs in the track list (aside from not being into “Childlike Things,”) and promptly having my mind completely blown by “Striptease.” Just the lilting, minor-key melody of the verses alone is so alluring, and sounds so bizarre for a pop song, that it’s hard to forget about the track once you hear it for the first time. Then, after the majority of the song’s trap-influenced sound, Twigs goes full ethereal club-mode for the coda, even throwing in one of the most dramatic vocal motifs of her career on the back end of the track - sounding a little bit like an operatic Dolores O’Riordan. All the while, she compares the act of becoming known by another person to the revealing, but calculated movements of a striptease. Like many great Twigs tracks, it’s equally sensual and ethereal, while combining sounds and styles that feel ancient, visceral, and cutting-edge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like James Said, by U.S. Girls</p>
<p>If I had more sway in this world, U.S. Girls and Meg Remy generally would be globally revered as one of the best pop acts working today. No matter how I feel about the overall experience of some of their records, they always put out at least one track that completely blows me away. For 2025’s <em>Scratch It,</em> that track was “Like James Said” - a prog-pop homage to James Brown whose character has “felt low for so long now, I’m ready for a change,” and invokes the power of dancing alone to feel better. There is also a great guitar solo on the back end of the track, and some dramatic string motifs that raise the stakes. A fantastic, fun, and true song in a discography full of them!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incomprehensible, by Big Thief</p>
<p>A song that, for me, hits me like a brick every time I put it on. Instrumentally, it’s some of Big Thief’s most lush work yet - with very psychedelic, meandering guitar sounds, and an ethereal, reverb-soaked atmosphere. Then there are touches of strings in the mix and shimmering percussion that give it an even more spectral vibe. That said, though, the main attraction for me in “Incomprehensible” is the lyrics - if for no other reason than just being exhausted of the discourse around women aging. In this track, Adrienne Lenker addresses the way that society gives us the language to fear getting older, and goes on to celebrate the beauty of the older women who gave her life (“My mother and my grandma/my great-grandmother too/wrinkle like the river/sweeten like the dew”) as well as the features of aging that she sees in herself, just shy of 33 years old. Lenker does this in such a beautifully poetic way that it stops me in my tracks each time I hear it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Illegal, by PinkPantheress</p>
<p>With the pop perfection of <em>Fancy That,</em> this spot could easily go to “Stateside” or “Tonight” as contenders for the best pop songs of the year. However, “Illegal” is the song that I found myself returning to most frequently, with its nocturnal vibe, shimmering synths, and fun singalong chorus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>iPod Touch, by Ninajirachi</p>
<p>2010s revival that sounds so good, I would prefer to listen to it than nearly any EDM hits that actually came out in the 2010s! On “iPod Touch,” Ninajirachi dives headfirst into digital nostalgia, and the more wholesome ways that technology colored the childhood memories of people born in the late 90s/early 2000s.</p>

<p>Berghain (feat. Björk &amp; Yves Tumor), by Rosalia</p>
<p>On one of the most jaw-dropping singles of the year, Rosalia returned with dramatic string and choral arrangements, swooping operatic vocals, and a jaw-dropping combination of features from experimental auteurs Björk and Yves Tumor. It truly sounds like a pop song of larger-than-life, biblical proportions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Merge, by Swans</p>
<p>Does everything that this band touches turn to gold? Out of any track on Swans’ larger-than-life <em>Birthing,</em> “The Merge” is definitely evidence in their favor. Part sound collage, part swirling free jazz, part neo-folk, “The Merge” feels like a sonic rebirth and might be one of the most staggering pieces in their recent catalog.</p>

<p>Pretrial (Let Her Go Home), by Fiona Apple</p>
<p>On this year’s best protest song, Fiona Apple draws from her 2 years of experience as a court watcher in Maryland to sharply condemn the U.S. Cash-Bail system. Even when presumed innocent, people can be jailed pre-trial and cannot leave if they are unable to afford bail, which can devastate families as outlined in this song. Musically, Apple continues exploring the percussive, but austere arrangements that made 2020’s <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</em> so provocative.</p>

<li>
<p>Forget In Mass, by Deki Alem</p>
<p>On <em>Forget In Mass,</em> Swedish hip hop duo Deki Alem, who I had never heard of until this point, revive a classic 90’s trip hop sound. I may be biased because the 90’s trip hop scene is one of my all-time favorite musical movements, but I was really happy to see a project that utilized influence from this time in such a fresh-sounding way. The overall sound is dark, propulsive, and emphasizes the need to maintain consciousness and individuality in a time of unparalleled societal isolation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gutta child, by Gabriel Jacoby</p>
<p>At just 20 minutes, <em>gutta child</em> is a tour of the American South through detours of funk, blues, and R&amp;B. With its homespun arrangements of horns and keys, it’s an undeniably warm set of tracks that celebrates Jacoby’s Southern heritage. Songs like “the one” show how these genres can communicate selfless and romantic love, while “dirty south baby” solemnly mourns the disappearance of black men from his community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>♡, by Jane Remover</p>
<p>After aurally blending up the minds of their listeners with <em>Revengeseekerz</em> earlier this year, ♡ reworks previously released songs to show off Jane Remover’s penchant for pop appeal. It features some of the artist’s catchiest songs yet, and shows how they draw equally from 90’s and 2000’s pop and r&amp;b, along with the experimental pop of their peers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return The Day, by Dog Race</p>
<p>A ghoulish, yet infectious gothic rock effort. The vocal performances on this are very wispy and chilling, and the band show their commitment to developing sinister atmospheres with spectral synths and reverb-soaked choruses. It’s certainly very 80’s revivalist, but it’s very well-done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Poppies Bloom for No King, by Panopticon</p>
<p>An atmospheric, righteously angry black metal effort from a band who have consistently made some of the most grandiose, heartfelt projects in the genre for years. This is a showstopping listen, but I would not expect anything else from Panopticon at this point.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Late 2024 albums I enjoyed this year:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Heavy Metal, by Cameron Winters</p>
<p>Before the release of <em>Getting Killed</em> this year - an album that combines Winter and co’s knack for alt rock songwriting and more sophisticated jazz-influenced experimentation, Winter released a solo album showing off his songwriting abilities in late 2024. <em>Heavy Metal</em> is both casual and airtight, and Winter’s distinct voice works incredibly well in a singer-songwriter context.<br>
The timeless sound of this record is what truly sells it. The late 60’s/early 70’s Wurlitzer-fueled soul of “Nausicaa” makes it astonishingly sweet and catchy. The austere piano ballad “Drinking Age&quot; gives way to one of the most gratifying climaxes of the album, as does the slow crescendo and group vocals of single “0$.” Despite its classic sound, the record still manages to teeter on wooziness and unease, making it feel like an impressionistic incantation of a vintage 70’s album.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attempted Martyr, by Prostitute</p>
<p>One of the most dizzying, lacerating noise rock debuts I’ve heard in a long time. Uniquely, Prostitute combines the genre with influences from Arab music - particularly evident in the first half of this record, such as “Judge.” All the while, frontman Moe Kazra delivers unforgiving lyrics about his experiences with xenophobia while being Lebanese in the U.S., while also tackling more taboo themes like hedonistic desire on “Joumana Kayrouz.” It’s certainly an electrifying listen, and makes me excited for what the band might do next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amour, by babymorocco</p>
<p>Just a breezy, club-ready himbo pop record that has great energy and lots of fun moments. There’s late 90’s and 2000’s nostalgia, a dash of indie sleaze, a lot of sexual energy, and queer bangers in spades.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Older albums that stayed with me in 2025:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nunsexmonkrock, by Nina Hagen (1982)</p>
<p>Normally when I do the “older albums” list, I try to prioritize albums that I had discovered within the last 12 months. In the case of <em>Nunsexmonkrock,</em> I actually discovered the record back in 2021, but had such a renaissance with it that it felt wrong to not include it in this list. Hagen has a vocal range that is almost unparalleled - she can harken to an alien, gross old man in her lower register on “Smack Jack,” but can also squeal and scream in her upper register on tracks like “Cosmic Shiva,” named for her daughter who was an infant at the time. Throughout the record, Hagen sounds a bit like a gothic, German Kate Bush as she sings about aliens, Jesus, drugs, and whatever else crosses her mind.<br>
Even aside from her wiley vocals, she truly does take post punk to some unexpected places - from Chinese pentatonic music to reggae. Hagen also has an extremely creative referential relationship to rock music that reminds me of Patti Smith: she interpolates Jimi Hendrix on the electrifying opener “Antiworld,” the B-52’s and David Bowie on “Iki Maska,” and The Doors on “Cosmic Shiva.” On the album’s bonus tracks that had been released prior to the album, she even does fantastic German covers of “White Punks On Dope” by the Tubes and “Lucky Number” by Lene Lovich. As a statement, <em>Nunsexmonkrock</em> celebrates rock music as much as it subverts it, and I am beginning to feel that it could be one of the most important post punk releases of the 80’s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You Must Be Certain of the Devil, by Diamanda Galás (1988)</p>
<p>In 2025, I was lucky enough to take a deeper dive into Diamanda Galás’ daunting and horrifying discography. Galás is a figure who I have venerated for years without finding her music to be all that accessible, mainly because I love her theatrics, her vocal terrors, and above all, the work that she has done to raise questions about global issues. Upon listening to more of her records, though, I found that there is also a lot to love about her from a purely musical standpoint - and for no record is that more true for me than the final installment of her “Mask of the Red Death” AIDS trilogy: <em>You Must Be Certain of the Devil.</em><br>
On this record, Galás makes use of her gospel influences to glorious effect - sometimes reminding me of Nick Cave if he was a woman and also, completely insane. The instrumentals are dark and forebearing, and pair the earthiness of gospel with subtle, chilly electronics: I love what the deep, industrial bassline of “Double-Barrel Prayer” does for the track’s dark atmosphere, and the rickety percussion on “Let’s Not Chat About Despair.” Above all, though, I am completely in love with this record’s title track. Not only does it provide a bit of levity from the darkness of the remainder of the album with its sticky vocal melodies (I think it’s Galás’ most catchy song???), but I also think the hooting and hollering in the track’s midsection is incredibly cathartic. In short, I think that for anyone looking to get into Diamanda Galás but feeling daunted, <em>You Must Be Certain of the Devil</em> is a great place to start - especially for enthusiasts of gothic music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ESKA, by ESKA (2015)</p>
<p>As someone who has been interested in art pop and experimental pop for years, I find it so very baffling that I did not find this album until 2025. What’s more is I actually discovered it on a random album generator (Shfl) when I wanted to listen to something new. That being said, ESKA’s self-titled 2015 debut was absolutely one of my favorite discoveries of this year, and one of the most kaleidoscopic records I had in rotation.<br>
Musically, <em>ESKA</em> falls somewhere in between soul and folk music, and has a highly organic, pastoral sound with many unusual instrumental choices. For example, “Shades of Blue,” combines Asian-inspired arrangements of sitar (or rather, guitars that sound like sitars) with a reggae-influenced groove. Her vocals are incredibly emotive and acrobatic - on “Gatekeeper” alone, she growls like early Björk, and shows flexibility in her upper register that warrants comparison to Moses Sumney. Often, it feels like ESKA is tapping into something incredibly ancient and rustic with her music, which is reinforced by folklorical lyrics on songs like “She’s in the Flowers,” a folk jig inspired by Persephone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Urban Zulu, by Busi Mhlongo (1999)</p>
<p><em>Urban Zulu</em> is a seminal South African album, and one of several albums on this list that I found via beehype’s “Special: Classic Albums from Around the World.” While its album cover leaves a bit to be desired, Mhlongo’s <em>Urban Zulu</em> redefined maskandi: a form of Zulu folk music with percussive guitar techniques and commonly associated with South Africa’s male migrant worker population. With her unforgettable voice, Mhlongo combined this folk tradition with modern, international influences to create a gorgeous listening experience, and was solidified as a female trailblazer in South African music.<br>
While being mainly rooted in the maskandi sound, there is a diverse array of beautiful sounds to be found on <em>Urban Zulu</em>. “Yise Wabant’a Bami (Father of My Children)” is a gorgeous guitar-led ballad that would sound at home on a folk record from decades before. However, “Zithin’Lzizwe” is a highlight that better represents the overall sound of the album, with a transcendental repeated melodic refrain that’s supported by propulsive guitar-picking and Mhlongo’s own vocal modulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On How Life Is, by Macy Gray (1999)</p>
<p>A wise, soulful R&amp;B debut that plays out like an early Fiona Apple record if she had been about a decade older and even more world-weary in 1999. With a neo-soul palette that draws from facets of black music from funk to R&amp;B to hip hop to gospel, Macy Gray sings about all sorts of life experiences with her distinct, raspy voice. The album that results is incredibly realized and mature, and also extremely catchy.<br>
There really is a song on this album for nearly every human emotion. “Caligula” and “Sex-o-matic Venus Freak” are groovy and sexual, while “I Try” and “Still” are melancholic songs about mourning lost love and unhealthy relationships. Elsewhere, “I’ve Committed A Murder” fantasizes about murder, while “I Can’t Wait to Meetchu” fantasizes about dying and reaching the afterlife. All the while, Macy Gray’s emotive singing and the record’s bombastic, genre-defying instrumentals and larger-than-life choruses make it an unforgettable listen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m the One, by Annette Peacock (1972)</p>
<p>An album that is both delightful and uncompromising. From the start with the opening title track, Peacock combines the soulful vocal acrobatics of Laura Nyro with the jazzy noir vibes of Patty Waters (along with a hint of Patti Smith’s swagger) to great effect. Additionally, <em>I’m the One</em> was recorded in a series of single takes recorded live, giving it a jazz feel, while also offering some of the most insane-sounding synth experimentation of the early 70’s. On nearly every track, Peacock processes her own vocals with Moog synthesizers, but never at the expense of the raw power of her vocal range.<br>
While this album is spacey and experimental, many of its moments are infectious, or at the very least rewarding for a patient listener. The swaggering funk-rock of the opening title track is certainly a highlight, but the whirring synths of later tracks like “Been &amp; Gone” and “Blood” also offer an otherworldly experience. Just completely in a league of its own, whether you consider it in the context of 1972 or broadly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Essra Mohawk, by Essra Mohawk (1974)</p>
<p>Just a great work of blue-eyed soul from the 70’s that my partner discovered! On the album, Essra sings a lot about change and reincarnation/rebirth, starting from the very first track “New Skins for Old.” All the while, she dons distinct, powerful vocals that any Laura Nyro fan would enjoy, while being grounded by arrangements that feel right at home with other piano-driven songwriting greats of this time period, like Carole King.<br>
Even with some more traditional instrumentation, though, Essra Mohawk’s approach shines through as being particularly vivid and wiley. She covers Gershwin’s “Summertime” frenetically and with a lot of interest, and brings a lot of jazzy energy and bliss to the album’s other original tracks - whether it’s funky tracks like “Back in the Spirit,” more heavy and experimental ones like “Song to an Unborn Soul,” or ballads like “I Can Not Forget.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bocanada, by Gustavo Cerati (1999)</p>
<p>A lovely late 90’s Argentinian work of trip hop, blending the genre with elements of dream pop, downtempo, and neo-psychedelia. On track after track, Cerati lets his layered production shine through his ethereal work on the instrumentation. His vocals are great, too - he sings very passionately and concocts some enthralling choruses and hooks on the album.<br>
Throughout the record, and notably on tracks like “Beautiful” Cerati implements some 70’s-flavored jazz and soft rock stylings into his sound that help to build a very sensual atmosphere. Elsewhere, he taps into folktronica on “Perdonar es Divino,” and uses lush shoegaze-tinged guitars on “Paseo Inmoral.” Similar to how <em>OK Computer</em> saw Radiohead move into psychedelia and electronic-tinged atmospherics, <em>Bocanada</em> feels a lot like Cerati’s offering to the omnivorous and futuristic sound of alternative music in the late 90’s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stories to Tell, by Flora Purim (1974)</p>
<p>This is a fantastic jazz fusion record! Earlier in the year, I actually took a “History of Jazz” course at my university for fun, and reaped a lot of great recommendations from that! When learning about Brazilian jazz, I particularly took to the work of Flora Purim - she has a way of using her voice as an instrument, sometimes wordlessly, and reaches a lot of creative peaks on this LP with the support of stellar instrumentalists that include her husband Airto Moreira, Carlos Santana, George Duke, and Ron Carter. The overall sound is vibrant and incredibly lyrical - whether passages are being led by Flora herself or by soloists in her incredible ensemble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verses of Comfort, Assurance &amp; Salvation, by Au Revoir Simone (2005)</p>
<p>Just a quaint mid-2000’s indie debut that really spoke to me this year, discovered by looking through a list of albums that David Lynch enjoyed - saying that they “really [made him] dream.” It’s a fantastic vibe, influenced by synth pop and folktronica, and naturally grazed by 2000’s twee. It also has a very bifurcated feeling, with the first half of the record having a much more playful vibe than the more atmospheric, sinister second half. I also enjoy the lyrics quite a bit - they are often very fanciful, with magical imagery (“Then the moon swept down to greet us/It was warm and made of flowers”). At a breezy 28 minutes, Au Revoir Simone’s debut still holds as a pleasant, dreamy respite from reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MELTING MOMENT, by POiSON GiRL FRiEND (EP) (1992)</p>
<p>The first of 2 bonus not-quite-albums that I wanted to include on this list: POiSON GiRL FRiEND may be one of my most treasured discoveries of 2025. Her EP <em>MELTING MOMENT</em> is particularly lush - along with being irresistibly romantic and international. There are icy trip-hop beats, synthetic but warm beds of strings, and pining in English, French, and Japanese. It’s equally clubbish and dreamy, feeling as indebted to the French yé-yé girls like Francoise Hardy as it does to 90’s electronic and trip hop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abu Ali, by Ziad Rahbani (Single) (1979)</p>
<p>Just a great work of disco music made by none other than Ziad Rahbani - the son of Lebanese music legend Fairouz, who went on to have an incredible career in his own right. <em>Abu Ali</em> is a 13-minute single that wordlessly takes on disco and funk music, creating a majestic and cinematic musical journey. The string and horn arrangements are fantastic, and there is use of ney flute and hand drums that bring the track a distinctly Levantine sound. There are plenty of other places to venture with Rahbani’s work, but this legendary single is certainly a good starting point.</p>
</li>
