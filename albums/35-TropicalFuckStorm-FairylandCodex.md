Easily the darkest and most interesting Tropical Fuck Storm record yet. While tracks like opener “Irukandji Syndrome” see the band elaborate on the noise-punk sound they're known for, the rest of the tracklist goes into deeply interesting territory. I love the Nick Cave-adjacent vibes of “Goon Show,” and the impassioned vocal performances that Fiona and Erica give on later tracks like “Teeth Marché.” Very noisy, proggy, and dark.
