After several years of creating some of the best shoegaze in the scene, Parannoul has changed gears significantly to give us *Seeking Darkness* under his new Huremic project. Divided into five parts, this sprawling record is the artist’s foray into post-rock. Equally psychedelic and aggressive, *Seeking Darkness* exceeds any expectations, showing once again how visionary of an artist Parannoul is (and in a completely novel way).
