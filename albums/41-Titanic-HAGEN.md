A great release from the Mexico City duo consisting of cellist Mabe Fratti and guitarist Héctor Tosta. As a cellist myself, I have been so excited by Mabe Fratti’s career in particular, and this record was no exception. The cello serves as a grounding, earthy force on this record as the duo make songs that feel expansive and experimental, but still have a surprising degree of infectiousness.
