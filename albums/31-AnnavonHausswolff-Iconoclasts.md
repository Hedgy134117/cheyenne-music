On a project that feels nearly crushed by its own atmosphere, organist and vocalist Anna von Hausswolff tackles change and renewal. The soundscape she creates on this album is incredible and unique \- there’s a presence of saxophone on the album (“The Beast”) that gives it jazz leanings. The heaviness of the organ is also expertly counterbalanced by Anna’s own buoyant vocals, and the two seem to work in perfect synergy. From start to finish, *Iconoclasts* is a work of truly epic proportions.
