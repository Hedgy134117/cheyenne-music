What a wild ride\! As acknowledged exhaustively by Pitchfork, *Los Thuthanaka* exists at a unique and special intersection of a lot of sounds. Specifically, it combines indigenous tradition and digital noise. “Phuju” is a huayño, a festive Andean dance, that is also full of noisy synths and DJ tags. “Apnaqkaya Titi” and “Awila” subvert traditional Bolivian dances with pummelling punk guitars and drums. It is the best and most dizzying kind of fusional, anticolonialist music \- and it’s so maximalist that you really have to listen to it yourself to believe what’s happening.
