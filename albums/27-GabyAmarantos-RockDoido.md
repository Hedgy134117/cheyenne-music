What a trip\!\!\! At 22 songs but only 37 minutes, this album plays out like an assault of nonstop hits that celebrate Brazilian dance music. However, its international influences and callbacks are reminiscent of an M.I.A. record \- over the course of the record, there are nods to brega, reggaeton, Brazilian funk, Western popular music, and even Arabian music to some extent on “Short Beira Cu.” Listening to it from start to finish feels like the most fun it’s possible to have.
