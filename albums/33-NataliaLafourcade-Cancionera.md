Mexican folk singer-songwriter Natalia Lafourcade has basically been on a generational run since the turn of the decade, and *Cancionera* continues the magic. With the ornate orchestration of her recent records, she has really been able to show off her uncanny sense of timing \- letting her compositions breathe when needed, leading to a lot of serene instrumental stretches. It’s all the more impressive that, from what I heard, the songs were recorded in one take\! From front to back, a lot of tonal ground is covered \- from the lightheartedness of “Cocos en la Playa” to the eeriness of “Luna Cresciente.” This makes *Cancionera* a pretty varied listen, but make no mistake \- all of it is quality\!
