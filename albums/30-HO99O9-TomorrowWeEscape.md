A gritty, sharp record that reassures us that punk rap/rap metal doesn’t always have to be a gimmick. On *Tomorrow We Escape,* the band appear comfortable with exploring all of the extremities of their sound \- “Escape” sees them create a pretty overt metal track with a sweeping chorus, and “Incline” (feat. Nova Twins, Pink Siifu & Yung Skrrt) is an electrifying hip hop crossover that combines hardcore hip hop with punk aggression. Elsewhere, “Target Practice” is an industrial-influenced rager that would sound right at home on a NIN record. All in all, this is just absolutely fantastic, and had me feeling very hype every time I listened to it.
