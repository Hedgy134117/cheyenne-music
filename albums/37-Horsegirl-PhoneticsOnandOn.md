A wiry, infectious record that sees Horsegirl do a lot with a relatively subdued sound. Band members Penelope Lowenstein and Nora Cheng charmingly alternate on vocal duties, giving unpretentious vocal performances that highlight the opacity of their lyrics and the spaciousness of the songs’ mixes. It’s a simple, but refreshing indie rock listen that’s also full of pop appeal and great melodies.
