On *Forget In Mass,* Swedish hip hop duo Deki Alem, who I had never heard of until this point, revive a classic 90’s trip hop sound. I may be biased because the 90’s trip hop scene is one of my all-time favorite musical movements, but I was really happy to see a project that utilized influence from this time in such a fresh-sounding way. The overall sound is dark, propulsive, and emphasizes the need to maintain consciousness and individuality in a time of unparalleled societal isolation.
