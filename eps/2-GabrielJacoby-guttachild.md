At just 20 minutes, *gutta child* is a tour of the American South through detours of funk, blues, and R\&B. With its homespun arrangements of horns and keys, it’s an undeniably warm set of tracks that celebrates Jacoby’s Southern heritage. Songs like “the one” show how these genres can communicate selfless and romantic love, while “dirty south baby” solemnly mourns the disappearance of black men from his community.
