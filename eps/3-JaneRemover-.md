After aurally blending up the minds of their listeners with *Revengeseekerz* earlier this year, ♡ reworks previously released songs to show off Jane Remover’s penchant for pop appeal. It features some of the artist’s catchiest songs yet, and shows how they draw equally from 90’s and 2000’s pop and r\&b, along with the experimental pop of their peers.
