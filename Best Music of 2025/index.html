<p>The Passionate Ones, by Nourished by Time</p>
<p>An AOTY for Nourished By Time has been years in the making: in 2023, I absolutely loved Erotic Probiotic 2, along with last year’s Catching Chickens EP. Marcus Brown has an undeniably wistful, emotive voice, which helps him to really sell his songs about love and labor under capitalism. On <em>The Passionate Ones,</em> Brown’s pop sensibility comes to the forefront, and the result is his most immediate set of songs yet, and a jarringly perfect pop album for our times<br>
Brown sure can build a track - his penchant for layers on <em>The Passionate Ones</em> is part of what gives its songs their perfect sense of timing. “BABY BABY” is a perfect example of this: its stark, blown-out vocal layers at the intro eventually build into a bombastic synth swell during iterations of the chorus. Other notable moments include the gorgeous sample used in the chorus of “Max Potential,” an ode to love in a capitalist hellscape (“if I’m gonna go insane/At least I’m loved by you”); and just the entirety of “9 2 5:” an addictive dancefloor number about a character who tries to play the system (and stay alive) by writing love songs after shifts at his restaurant day job.<br>
Singles aside, the song that really led me to consider this album for AOTY is actually the second track, “Idiot in the Park.” In an album full of earnest songs about protecting your humanity (and passion), “Idiot in the Park” takes a much more absurd approach by writing about an interaction between the narrator and a psychic in the park, who “says she knows what Jesus knows.” There’s a lot of humor in the song, with Brown complaining, “she’s giving me the runaround,” and “she didn’t ever read my palms, so I know she’s gonna get me wrong.” But with that, the narrator also finds meaning in interacting with this “Idiot in the Park,” when “she says she knows I lost a friend,” and “she made me laugh, she made me cry.” The song becomes incredibly affecting, and maybe says a bit about what you can get out of spontaneous interactions in your community, and especially in the age of stranger danger.<br>
It is my utmost belief that the type of omnivorous R&amp;B and powerful messaging that Brown is giving us as Nourished By Time is vitally important. It takes a lot of courage and energy to preserve your love and humanity while the world is unravelling, but <em>maybe</em> it can be done, and <em>maybe</em> we can fight for ourselves and others in the meantime. Earworm choruses and genre concoctions aside, rising above despair is the message that Marcus Brown delivers in this album, and it is one that I will try my hardest to take with me into 2026.</p>

<p>Eusexua, by FKA Twigs</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Eusexua as an era: the original album tracklist, along with the second version and the <em>Afterglow</em> record, has been the single best musical moment of 2025. This album stayed with me throughout the entire year - I was enamoured with the original the moment it came out, and its highlights (the title track, “Room of Fools,” “Keep It, Hold it,” and ESPECIALLY “Striptease”) soundtracked my entire year, from start to finish.<br>
There were hangups, though. For one, I hated “Childlike Things” and wasn’t that sold on “Perfect Stranger” either. Then, November came… and she released another version of Eusexua that happened to replace a few tracks I wasn’t sold on with new tracks that were absolutely perfect (I especially loved “Perfectly”). Is this cheating??? Who’s to say - regardless, by the time I was making this list, I could not deny the fact that Eusexua belonged in the top 3.<br>
I have been a fan of FKA Twigs since around 2018, and witnessing the release of this album as a long-time fan was nothing short of sublime. With the precise emotions it captures in its lyrics, its euphoric sonic experiments, and perhaps most importantly, Twigs’ vocals sounding as free and unbridled as they’ve ever sounded (especially recalling the climax of “Striptease” and just the entirety of “Room of Fools”) - Eusexua truly feels like Twigs’ most raw musical statement. As I listen to it, I can’t help but feel that this is exactly the sort of sound and message she has spent years working towards - it’s incredible to see her reach this point in her career.<br>
When promoting this album, I remember seeing FKA Twigs talk about the profound healing that she was able to do while regularly raving in Prague, and how that inspired Eusexua. Throughout the record, she evokes a number of emotions - from going out and feeling yourself (“Girl Feels Good,” “Drums of Death”), to wrestling with your demons (“Keep It, Hold It”), to attempting at intimacy/vulnerability (“Sticky,” “Eusexua”). At its core, Eusexua is about going out and melding with others who are also wrestling with something - encapsulated by “We build something together,” as she says on “Room of Fools.” The record is a reminder that healing can come from unexpected places, and sometimes, just going out and experiencing other people can help.</p>

<p>hexed!, by aya</p>
<p>For most of the 2020s so far, most of the most acclaimed acts and records are the ones that successfully harness and replicate the energy of a bygone era - from the pandemic-era disco craze to the 90s fascination in indie rock, all of us seem to be craving an escape to an era that is less humiliating than our own. It’s easy to get bored of nostalgia, which is why I find it so exciting when I find an album by an artist who seems to be doing something completely fresh and different. This year, that album for me was <em>hexed!,</em> by aya.<br>
aya snuck onto the experimental electronic scene in 2021 with <em>im hole</em> - a record that I found particularly isolating and memorable with its psychedelic intensity and slow, amorphous pace. While that album offered a particularly decided sense of identity, <em>hexed!</em> benefits from a bit more structure, and there’s newfound accessibility in a lot of these track with club-ready beats and menacing, but sticky hooks (see “off to the ESSO,” “the names of f***** chav boys,” “droplets,” and “navel glazer”).<br>
Across the record, <em>hexed!</em> blisters with the pain of survivorship - inspired by aya’s own chastisement from growing up queer, as well as her experiences with getting sober. The lyrics are dark and scathing, with aya’s own vocal delivery ranging from chanting, to screaming, to whispering. Some lyrics express a desire for oblivion (“No more gravity/no more inertia/heat death/everything stop”), others explore nightmares through images like “vulpine features strangled with a power cord.” There are also lyrics that really powerfully capture the feeling of being “stuck” in your own trauma while the world keeps moving around you, (particularly, “I used to say some shit about a stopped clock/As the time slipped right off my hands,” which is one of my favorite bars on the album).<br>
All the while, her voice seems to be at war with the abrasive instrumentals supporting her - for example, in “heat death,” the lyrics are punctuated by 8-bit “bleeps” while a deep, industrial bassline bubbles beneath. The soundscapes are turbulent, feeling like they could explode at any moment - and when they do, they produce moments that are equally terrifying and cathartic. Amidst all of the terror on this album, whenever I returned to it, I couldn’t help but feel like everything that was going on just sounded really <em>cool</em> - it’s obvious that a lot of care went into concocting a soundscape this unhinged, and aya’s efforts were successful by all means.</p>

<p>Revengeseekerz, by Jane Remover</p>
<p>The fact that Jane Remover is one of the most recognizable names in experimental music merely 3 albums into their career is known by nearly everyone at this point. However, until <em>Revengeseekerz</em> came out this Spring, I don’t know if any of us knew they could rage <em>this</em> hard. Largely leaving behind the shoegaze-y sound of 2023’s <em>Census Designated, Revengeseekerz</em> sees the artist fully embrace rage, while giving it a spin that only they could give it.<br>
“Overload” doesn’t even begin to describe what’s happening here - the tracks on <em>Revengeseekers</em> feel like they’re bursting at the seams with trap beats, bitcrushed synths, record scratches, samples, and whatever else Jane felt could fit into the mix. The result is an amalgam of hyperpop, rage, trap, and EDM that surprises at every turn - and after every subsequent listen.<br>
That being said, while <em>Revengeseekers</em> does often feel like chaos, Jane Remover is certainly in control of what’s happening at every turn. Tracks like “JRJRJR” are full of old samples of their old music for fans to unpack, and there are also surprise guitars on “Fadeoutz,” choirs on “angels in camo,” and harmonicas on “Dreamflashers.” Truly, there are surprises at every point when you’re willing to peel back some of this album’s hooks and layers. On other tracks, though, like the frenetic Danny Brown-featured “Psychoboost,” it’s best to just let yourself be taken away by the mayhem.<br>
“JRJRJR” is where everything begins (and ends) with this project. Released on the first day of 2025, the single was full of glitch and braggadocio, not to mention equally catchy and mind-frying. The track sees the artist taunt how they can’t be contained, saying “I might ball out on a new face, change my name, then my city.” Seeing how chameleonic their career and persona has been, it’s easy to believe them, and hard not to embark on their experimental victory lap with them.</p>

<p>A City Drowned in God’s Black Tears, by Infinity Knives &amp; Brian Ennals</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Between this one and another record later in the top 5, 2025 has been a great year for Baltimore. On this record, my first exposure to both Infinity Knives (producer) and Brian Ennals (rapper), the duo slid seamlessly between different styles and headspaces to make a truly holistic, awestriking hip hop experience.<br>
Truth be told, I almost did not include this in my final top 50 because it came out around the time when I was nose-deep in finals in the Spring. I discovered it through a Fantano review, listened to it, absolutely loved it, listened to it again, and then forgot about it until today (12/23). I am so endlessly glad I got my bearings and remembered how much I love this album so I can put it in my top 5 of 2025, exactly where it belongs.<br>
The opening track, “The Iron Wall,” plunges the listener into scathing experimental hip hop, in such a way that everyone from Netanyahu and the IDF, to Donald Trump and the CIA, to Gal Gadot catches strays. Elsewhere, “Live at the Chinese Buffet” is a track full of atmosphere and critiques of the hip hop sphere, and “Trevoga” and “Sometimes, Papi Chulo” see Infinity Knives toy with gorgeous Russian folk and salsa, respectively. All the while, they enlist a host of talented features - including talented vocalists like FRANKI3, Vladena Volodkevich, and Gabriela Bibiana that really sell the different styles that the duo are trying to push forward. The fact that these two managed to pull off such a wide array of styles is one thing, but it’s the fact that they manage to coexist so well in this duo’s record that blows my mind.<br>
I also appreciate the persona that Brian Ennals constructs as a rapper throughout this record. Based on his views and the people he calls out, it’s obvious that he’s a humanitarian who wants better for the world. However, he equally seems to feel that he has nothing to lose, having no qualms about calling out what he sees in both our world leaders and the music industry. In music, there will always be value in genuineness and truth-telling, and it’s always refreshing to hear people say whatever the hell they want in such an inventive way.</p>

<p>Getting Killed, by Geese</p>
<p>2025 may have been the year of good sophomore releases - if I’m not mistaken, they make up about half of my top 10! But the fact that Geese spiritually (if not literally) had <em>the</em> sophomore album of 2025 is not lost on anyone. After bursting onto the scene in 2023 with their breakout effort <em>3D Country</em>, raising rumors that they were going to bring back “real” rock ‘n’ roll, <em>Getting Killed</em> saw them explode to legendary proportions in one of the most universal and well-deserved hype trains of recent memory.<br>
<em>Getting Killed</em> actually sees Geese leave behind some of what made them popular with <em>3D Country.</em> Where the latter shone with memorable singalong choruses and focused genre studies, <em>Getting Killed</em> has a sound that can go to some extreme depths. Cameron Winter, continuing down the vocal path he explored on his late 2024 singer-songwriter record, wails emotively on this project - landing somewhere between the soulful wiles of Tim Buckley and the desperation of Lou Reed. The wild choirs of the title track feel cultish, and the “chorus” of opener “Trinidad” blisters and explodes as Winter screams “THERE’S A BOMB IN MY CAR.” There’s also a sort of unspoken darkness to how Geese approach their grooves: on a lot of these tracks (eg. “100 Horses”), there aren’t many huge left turns going on in the rhythm section, but the shifting dynamics and intensity create a chugging, krautrock-adjacent vibe that feels equally jammy, earthy, and dark.<br>
But, as Geese fans know, these songs are also endlessly beautiful and irresistible. There’s the swaggering and sweet “Baby”-punctuated chorus of “Cobra,” the twinkling guitars and piano of “Au Pays du Cocaine,” and the pop rock melody of “Taxes” that comes to build so much catharsis, just to name a few. The latter of those also offers one of the most affecting and relatable American political sentiments of the year, as Cameron sings about how “I [we] should burn in hell” for the atrocities committed by the United States using our tax money, going on to say that he would rather die than pay his taxes. Another climax of the record is the closer “Long Island City Here I Come,” which deals in fast-paced, frenetic grooves and incredible one-liners like “Like Joshua kicked the king out of Jericho/I'm about to kick your ass up and down this street,” and “The lord has a lot of friends, and in the end/He'll probably forget he's ever met you before.” With so much energy and catharsis, <em>Getting Killed</em> certainly holds as the most refreshing rock album of the year.</p>

<p>Portrait of my Heart, by SPELLLING</p>
<p>For many people who follow music even a little closely, the release of <em>The Turning Wheel</em> in the Summer of 2021 was a pretty rapturous moment. Equally symphonic and mysterious, it was a record full of meticulously crafted arrangements, lyrics that were both whimsical and revealing, and Chrystia Cabral’s emotive, distinct voice. Additionally, the record had the most complex and rewarding melodies I had heard in pop music in a long while - see the chameleonic and genius chorus of opener “Little Deer.” So… what does one do after making such a painstakingly gorgeous, and unfathomably difficult-to-make album?<br>
In <em>Portrait of my Heart’s</em> case, the answer seems to be simply letting loose a little bit. This time around, Cabral went in an alt-rock direction without compromising any of her distinct, witchy vibe or melodic prowess, and the results are fantastic - and <em>so</em> much fun. The cool symphonic arrangements and synth-work are still there in spades (“Destiny Arrives”!!!!!!), but are now accompanied by energetic underlying rock instrumentation, which works in Cabral’s favor to bring some propulsion to her sound. The result is somewhere between 90’s grunge, pop-punk, nu metal, and Disney channel rock - and is a fusion that is ever so close to my heart.<br>
I think that a lot of the charm of this album just comes with how much earnestness Cabral approaches this project with. She wears her influences on her sleeve a bit by bravely covering My Bloody Valentine’s “Sometimes” (and doing a great job with it!). Across the project, her passionate vocals on the choruses of tracks like “Alibi” and “Love Ray Eyes” elevate them to heroic proportions and save them from flaccid nostalgia. As she navigates “love, intimacy, anxiety, and alienation,” in her words, her earnest delivery of these emotions makes you feel like you’re right there with her - being a wide-eyed spectator and subject of these grandiose, universal feelings. It may be a more visceral, low-hanging fruit than <em>The Turning Wheel,</em> and it could just be the same emotional tricks that have been played on us by notorious pop-rock feeling-feelers like Paramore and Alanis Morissette for decades - but it really does feel so right, both then and now.</p>

<p>Big City Life, by SMERZ</p>
<p>Great music. Deliriously lobotomized. “My IQ low and my shoe heels high.” But also… it’s so hypnotic? So psychedelic? I could melt into the shuffling, trip hop-flavored backing track of “But I do” for hours. Not a single track feels long enough, including the 5-minute “You got time and I got money.” That being said, I find it difficult to write about why this album works so well, because a lot of the appeal is just the vibe it exudes, making it feel immune to intellectualization.<br>
It could all boil down to the instrumental decisions that this album makes. While being pretty minimal on the surface, a lot of the smaller details are very odd and surprising, but work perfectly. The somewhat dissonant string pizzicato of “Feisty” is a great example of that - it shouldn’t belong on a pop track, but also feels right at home here. The duo take a deadpan, somewhat wry approach to their vocal delivery (there’s definitely a hint of Coco &amp; Clair Clair in there), and their lyrics are often nonsensical, giving the project a lot of humor. However, just when you start to get adjusted to the duo’s ironic tone, moments of awestriking beauty sneak up on you. The understated vocals and plucked instrumentation of “A thousand lies,” for example, are an absolutely gorgeous combination and make for the album’s most dreamlike track.<br>
That being said, the song that really sells <em>Big City Life,</em> and the one on everyone’s minds, is the slow-burn love song “You got time and I got money.” There’s an analog ambience to the drums and bassline of this song that creates a gorgeous atmosphere along with the strings and hummed refrains. Again, the lyrics on this song can be bizarre at points, but sometimes they’re so earnest that they really work, even when straddling the romance of the song with the group’s inherent humor and irreverence (“Baby, can I see you naked? (please)/Even though I love how you dress”). While this track is certainly unique in the scheme of the album, it also epitomizes the balancing act the duo does that makes <em>Big City Life</em> so great: it feels both introverted and undeniably pop, both highbrow and lowbrow, and both silly and transcendental.</p>

<p>Pirouette, by Model/Actriz</p>
<p>Pop music can be a complicated medium for queerness. Particularly since we presently seem to be undergoing a conservative regression - there is a very loud vacancy of queer artists who are both high profile and universally respected. In particular, Sam Smith and Lil Nas X have seen pretty significant declines in popularity. And all the while, a Mormon kid named Benson Boone is doing backflips in skintight, sparkly jumpsuits. Now, more than ever, queerness catapults straight, boring artists into superstardoms while actual queer artists struggle to reach an audience, and are sequestered to alternative spaces.<br>
Despite all of this, Model/Actriz followed up their incredibly dark, unnerving, no-wave-inflected debut <em>Dogsbody</em> with <em>Pirouette:</em> a sophomore effort that often feels a bit like a pop album. From the start with the falsetto hook of “Vespers,” Cole Haden approaches popstar sensibility a la Circus-era Britney with genre-melding confidence as he straddles industrial/no-wave music and German techno. The sound is simultaneously anxious and club-ready, producing moments like “Diva” whose spoken verses ooze with swagger, but also like “Acid Rain,” whose soft instrumentation and gentle melodies bizarrely harken to Y2K adult pop (the vibe of Tori Amos’ “A Sorta Fairytale” comes to mind).<br>
An important difference between <em>Dogsbody</em> and <em>Pirouette</em> comes when considering how each of them approach discussing queerness. Where <em>Dogsbody</em> was rapt with hedonism, shame, and overt sexuality, <em>Pirouette</em> takes more of a self-possessed and unpacked approach. Some tracks, like closer “Baton,” are more about how vulnerable it feels to be perceived by others when, for example, they remember something about you that you forgot. In “Diva,” Haden meets other gay men in Europe with the obstacle of having nowhere to take them home (“No home to take you home to”), showing the intersection of loneliness and scarcity. In “Cinderella,” Haden recalls wanting a Cinderella birthday party when he was five but not asking for one because of a conscious fear of betrayal and abandonment. Thus, <em>Pirouette</em> comes as a poignant and thoughtful release, without sacrificing the band’s intrigue and experimentation.</p>

<p>I Love My Computer, by Ninajirachi</p>
<p>2025 was an awful year to be online, and was a year where just existing on Instagram left me feeling so depressed that I eventually decided to (gradually) cut it out of my life. Even still, I felt like the very problems I thought I was avoiding by being offline were infiltrating my life as a university student - as a professor encouraged AI-editing for my senior capstone paper that I spent the entirety of the semester poring over. Further, a doomsday mentality loomed over my graduation ceremony last week, as all of us were aware that, to varying extents, we worked for degrees that may come to nothing. With this backdrop, I find it surprising how easily I swallowed the techno-optimism (or at least, observationalism) of <em>I Love My Computer.</em> But - it seems to me that Ninajirachi’s love letter to EDM and computers came at the perfect time.<br>
This record makes the case for being raised on the internet not being <em>that</em> bad, without shying away from the dangers we all had to contend with. “iPod Touch” chronicles teen girlhood as it played out in the 2010s, and shows how being online wasn’t necessarily at odds with adolescence in the real world. The internet could bring you music that colored your childhood memories of going to the beach or the mall. “Fuck My Computer” is a hypnotic dubstep rager that’s about exactly what it says, delivered with an ironic and deadpan tone. Later, “CSIRAC” and “Infohazard” observe the darker corners of the internet, with the latter narrating the accidental finding of a snuff film online at too young of an age. “Delete” is about the phenomenon of posting and deleting thirst traps, and shows ambiguity about <em>who</em> these thirst traps are for - it could be Nina herself, or a crush who might see it in time, or it might just be her computer.<br>
Sonically, this album uniquely has nostalgia for 2010s EDM (particularly the Porter Robinson side of things) and dubstep, along with electroclash and hyperpop. I never thought that I had nostalgia for this specific genre or vibe, but the more colorful EDM-tinged tracks on this album evoke such specific and visual images for me - like scrolling through the original girlsgogames homepage before websites all became minimal/homogenized later in the 2010s. Occasionally, I am reminded of how real 2010s nostalgia is when I hear “Clarity” by Zedd in public and get the urge to sing along as dramatically as I can - a sentiment that I suspect Ninajirachi might share. Ultimately, there isn’t anything we can do to reverse the horrific changes that have been done to the internet, but I like the healthy mindset <em>I Love My Computer</em> puts forth in processing Gen Z chronic online-ness and maladaptive nostalgia, and I equally love the sonic jolt it gives me when I listen to it.</p>

<p>Lotus, by Little Simz</p>
<p><em>Lotus</em> was a unique listening experience for me this year because I both loved it immediately and took time to realize just how fantastic it was. Simz has been in an interesting position career-wise since <em>Sometimes I Might Be Introvert</em> because, while being inarguably on a victory lap, she has not fully attempted to re-capture that particular album’s symphonic, larger-than-life magic. In <em>Lotus’</em> case, the rapper creates an array of moments that approach career-defining grandiosity, but in a way that feels fresh and unique.<br>
A lot of the tracks on <em>Lotus</em> are flavored with rock and jazz, as well as the Afrobeat influences she had been exploring prior in her career. This relatively new and invigorated sound produces moments that are incredibly energetic (“Thief”), funky (“Enough”), and a lot of fun (“Young”). That being said, though, <em>Lotus</em> counterbalances this fun and energy with a lot of probing into Little Simz’s relationships with others - whether she’s calling out those who have used or wronged her like on the opener “Thief,” or deeply interrogating familial relationships as in the vulnerable track “Blood.” After many replays, I’ve come to the conclusion that <em>Lotus</em>, with the varied sonic and emotional experiences it provides, is one of the most rewarding records of the year - and in Simz’ discography.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tether, by Annahstasia</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A completely singular, unforgettable debut effort. Annahstasia has one of the most distinct voices I have heard in a while - it’s husky, expansive, and incredibly emotive. On this record, she manages to craft acoustic arrangements that suit her vocals perfectly. These instrumentals are highly naturalistic, but still feel detailed, flowing and swelling beautifully while still allowing Annahstasia’s vocals to completely hold the foreground.<br>
All the while, Annahstasia tells many intimate tales, often with uncertain relationships in mind. On “Unrest,” she experiences bliss with her partner, but is plagued by doubt. “Be Kind” beautifully unpacks both the difficulty and happy anticipation of being vulnerable with someone, and putting your best foot forward even though you “never learned/To be kind.” However, the album’s biggest standout comes with the closer “Believer,” with its emotional and instrumental swells as she confronts a lover. This track also features one of Annahstasia’s most arresting vocal performances, making it truly an emotional peak. After such an intricately crafted debut, I am beyond excited to see where Annahstasia goes next.</p>

<p>All Cylinders, by Yves Jarvis</p>
<p>In my mind, Yves Jarvis has always occupied a very frenetic, “jack-of-all trades” place in experimental/indie music. He has such a knack for melody, and his whimsical sense of song structure tends to tease the listener with a great motif or melody before jumping to the next idea. Contrastingly, <em>All Cylinders</em> shows Yves Jarvis in a place of unparalleled concentration. The results are an absolute delight to the ear from front to back, as the psychedelic musician lets ideas linger for a bit longer and develop into fantastic, nostalgic tracks.<br>
Yves Jarvis’ influences range far and wide on this project. The bombastic opener “With A Grain” equally recalls 60’s chamber pop and the more recent indie icon St. Vincent with its playful, slinking guitar passages. This is followed by “Gold Filigree” which is a fantastic exercise in early 70’s R&amp;B/soul slow jams, and “One Gripe,” which is full of pop shimmer and has some of the stickiest melodies on the album. Despite his omnivorous influences on <em>All Cylinder</em>, Yves concocts a sound that feels refreshing, and completely his own - one dream-like track at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fancy That, by PinkPantheress</p>
<p>In an ideal world, this would have been the biggest album of the year. Incredible tunes and remixes (the Nia Archives remix of Illegal???), great music videos, and that iconic Tiny Desk performance… As far as I’m concerned, 2025 has been her year. While I would love to see PinkPantheress try doing a longer record at some point, it is honestly impressive how much heat she manages to pack into this record’s 20 minute runtime - “Illegal,” “Tonight,” and “Stateside” alone are some of the best songs she’s ever put out.<br>
Part of the triumph of <em>Fancy That</em> is how it both retains and in some ways surpasses the homegrown vibe of PinkPantheress’ prior work. Her sound, especially on opener “Illegal,” is still very nocturnal and retains her UK garage and jungle influences, as well as her sense of emo nostalgia. However, I don’t think her music has ever sounded as club-ready as it does on “Stateside,” and as a whole, <em>Fancy That</em> is the most open about desire and sexuality that PinkPantheress has been in her career. Altogether, this was a really great, very hypnotic pop record, and represents an exciting leap in PinkPantheress’ career.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DÍA, by Ela Minus</p>
<p>Another record that speaks to the healing and introspective power of electronic music. <em>DÍA</em> came after a time of personal strife and uncertainty for Ela Minus after relocating during the pandemic, which is also when she began gaining traction for her debut record <em>acts of rebellion.</em> On this night-veiled follow-up, Ela looks inward while making her sound even more expansive (think Kelly Lee Owens). While hitting energetic highs, <em>DÍA</em> also rewards patient listeners with its meditative pacing - for example, during the openers “ABRIR MONTE” and “BROKEN.” The former begins with a deep, two-chord synth that lingers throughout the latter, even when the anthemic chorus is introduced and bursts with melody and color.<br>
The attitude of this album is world-weary, but mostly optimistic. On “BROKEN,” she sings “I’ll keep writing melodies/To sing away the gloom/That we have succumbed to.” “QQQ” is another highlight on the record - its arpeggiated synths and rhythmic drum patterns make it feel anthemic. However, the lyrics reveal Ela’s apocalyptic emotions as she sings in Spanish, “If it’s going to be like this/Let the world end.” Her sentiments speak to the experience of attempting to heal and do better while the world seems to be slowly ending, and <em>DÍA</em> as a whole is a powerful attempt to reconcile these emotions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Antigone, by Eiko Ishibashi</p>
<p>A lush, mythical, and quietly apocalyptic album, with boundless details to unpack. Truth be told, some of the best orchestration of 2025 can be found on this album - the way she layers her vocals with recordings of traffic instructions and twisted synths on opener “October” is genius. There’s a languidity and warmth to the music that calls to mind mid-70’s Joni Mitchell when she began to experiment with jazz - with occasional interjections from Americana, such as the pedal steel-inspired accordion on “Coma.”<br>
“Mona Lisa” is, lyrically, a very important glimpse into the philosophy of <em>Antigone.</em> It admonishes modern detachment from human suffering, as genocide is “glimpsing through each day.” There is also a lot of disarmingly chilling imagery on many of the tracks, like on Coma (“This is your grid, watched by the security camera/You still have some time/to be a survivor in Eden”) and “October” (“Ashes fall in August/In October, the blood shines”). But all the while, particularly on the jazzier cuts like the title track, Eiko’s presence on the album feels glowing and warm.</p>

<li>
<p>The Distaff, by Maud the Moth</p>
<p>Few things can get me excited about music like a really good new neoclassical darkwave album. Thus, I was elated to discover Maud the Moth and her wonderful record <em>The Distaff</em> back in February. Largely led by Amaya López-Carromero’s powerful vocals and piano playing, <em>The Distaff</em> ebbs and flows between symphonic peaks, and often sounds like pure catharsis.<br>
As the record flows, López-Carromero toys with a lot of different ways to achieve catharsis in different songs. The record has a lot of avant-metal leanings, which produces pummeling heights like that of “A temple by the river.” On “Siphonophores,” metal influence is present in the form of droning, blown-out guitars that sound more indebted to shoegaze. Undoubtedly, though, the nine-minute “Despenaperros” is the centerpiece of <em>The Distaff</em>, featuring slow-moving guitar and orchestral hits and epic choir-led vocals that greatly heighten the drama of the record. Whether she’s dealing in symphonic, metal, or piano-led palettes, <em>The Distaff</em> shows that Maud the Moth is a master of musical tension and release.</p>

<p>Bite Down, by Ribbon Skirt</p>
<p>An often scathing, revealing album that’s host to my favorite indie rock/post punk-y vocal performance of the year, courtesy of Tashiina Buswa. With many tracks inspired by Buswa’s Anishinaabe heritage, she expresses a lot of righteous anguish and rage whether she’s grappling with the weight of marginalized identity, or coping with other daily struggles. Her delivery can be deadpan and almost Valley Girl-adjacent (“Off Rez”), or impassioned and punk-y (the verses of “Wrong Planet”) - but always, Ribbon Skirt feel genuine.<br>
The songwriting on this record is pretty stripped-back, but done incredibly well. “Off Rez” is a particular highlight, as it can be very tongue-in-cheek, criticizing the scandal around Buffy Saint-Marie’s falsified heritage (“They want 2000s Buffy Marie / They want my status, but they’re getting my teeth”) while also earnestly mourning cultural erasure of indigenous people (“I wanna preserve every part that makes me/Not only know but really feel that I’m free”). “Cellophane” is another affecting track that takes a more impressionistic lyrical approach as Buswa describes the grief and shock of losing her grandfather. There are also influences and sounds from across the spectrum of alternative rock on this album - including post punk and shoegaze, which have been done to death by other indie rock groups but feel somehow refreshed in the hands of Ribbon Skirt.</p>

<p>FEMME FATALE, by Mon Laferte</p>
<p>I have to tell you… as far as Spanish-language albums go this year, <em>FEMME FATALE</em> was for me what Rosalia’s <em>LUX</em> seems to be for everyone else. I really adore this. The high-glam vibes are immaculate right off the bat with the title track, as we are immersed in the jazzy throwback vibe of the record. The smoky, nostalgic feel of the record is occasionally disrupted by Laferte’s own idiosyncrasies - such as the autotune-laden vocals on “Mi Hombre” and the bombastic, explosive vocal performance on “Otra Noche de Llorar” (a track that completely warrants any BjÖrk comparisons it elicits).<br>
One of my favorite things about <em>FEMME FATALE</em> is the fact that its penultimate track “My One And Only Love” combines Laferte’s vocal powers with those of two other legendary Latin American singers: Silvana Estrada and Natalia Lafourcade. The song itself is subtle and intimate with an underlying doo-wop rhythm, and it was just incredibly cool to see these three cross paths. Additionally, the other vocal collaborations on the record are also incredible - particularly the Nathy Peluso-featured “La Tirana,” which has an infectious Latin jazz feel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let God Sort Em Out, by Clipse</p>
<p>This one has been done to death in terms of discussion, but I will throw in my two cents by also corroborating that this is a really, really good comeback album. After Clipse’s initial bling-era run, it was difficult to conceptualize how this reunion could go. This became even more true when Pusha T had a career resurgence in the late 2010s. Fortunately, Clipse’s reunion resulted in possibly the most replayable, cinematic, and satisfying hip hop albums of the year - due in large part to the duo’s ability to keep things fresh on the project. Pharell’s production also does a lot of heavy lifting, perfectly complementing the content of the songs themselves.<br>
“Chains &amp; Whips” featuring Kendrick Lamar is a serious highlight of <em>Let God Sort Em Out</em> for me. Obviously, it was just electrifying to see Kendrick in the track list, but the song is also a masterclass in atmosphere-building with a sinister beat and pretty menacing bars from all parties involved. I also really loved the deeply personal angle of tracks like the opener, “The Birds Don’t Sing,” which unpacks and explores grief after the loss of the duo’s parents. Notably, too, “So Be It” has what is probably my favorite beat in any hip hop song this year, as it samples a 1970 track by Saudi composer Talal Maddah. Without a doubt, the highlights of this project come in spades, and I was really excited to see this comeback pan out as well as it did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeking Darkness, by Huremic</p>
<p>After several years of creating some of the best shoegaze in the scene, Parannoul has changed gears significantly to give us <em>Seeking Darkness</em> under his new Huremic project. Divided into five parts, this sprawling record is the artist’s foray into post-rock. Equally psychedelic and aggressive, <em>Seeking Darkness</em> exceeds any expectations, showing once again how visionary of an artist Parannoul is (and in a completely novel way).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hooke’s law, by keiyaA</p>
<p>The best possible way to summarize the overarching theme of this record comes in words that keiyaA penned herself, saying that “a downward spiral is a loaded spring.” After the affirmational air of her debut (2020’s <em>Forever, Ya Girl)</em>, <em>hooke’s law</em> sees keiyaA embrace tension and struggle, and she emerges from the other side intact. Amidst struggles with mental health and love, the production takes on a relaxed, but experimental alternative r&amp;b sound full of crisp beats and spacey synths - with significant influence from IDM and breakbeat. The resulting album is simultaneously wise and relaxed, particularly with keiyaA’s cool melodies drifting woozily on top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>45 Pounds, by YHWH Nailgun</p>
<p>This debut project sees the four-piece, New York-based experimental rock group create tightly organized chaos. With precise, rototom-heavy percussion and noisy, sawing synths and guitar, tracks breeze by with pummeling intensity. The vibe the group creates is equally danceable and ritualistic, and makes for some very exciting experimental rock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noble &amp; Godlike in Ruin, by Deerhoof</p>
<p>On their 20th studio album, the experimental rock veterans take inspiration from Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” to stitch together maximalist, dense compositions. While being as frenetic and raucous as ever, <em>Noble &amp; Godlike in Ruin</em> sees the group approach deeply interesting and existential territory - “Kingtoe” examines our relationships with machines in a very Deefhoofian way (“How can you be so human? / I heard that you were just an animal”). “Immigrant Songs” also delves into what it means to be an immigrant in Trump’s America, while having fantastic experimental passages. Altogether, this record proves that Deerhoof is just as imaginative and exciting as ever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nested in Tangles, by Hannah Frances</p>
<p>In 2024, Hannah Frances’ grief-stricken <em>Keeper of the Shepherd</em> captivated many. This year, she has already blown it out of the water with a record that explores familial trauma and subverts folk tradition. The arrangements are dense and captivating, with touches of free jazz and experimentation coming through that harken to 70’s Joni. That being said, some of the more uncanny vocal layering (mainly on the opening title track) hints at the grandiose art pop of Julia Holter, and there is also plenty of Americana influence that brings a lot of warmth to the mix. The mixture of ideas makes for one of the most captivating singer-songwriter projects of the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magic Alive!, by McKinley Dixon</p>
<p>A colorful, densely orchestrated jazz-rap album that sees McKinley Dixon continue the unbelievable run he has been on since his 2021 breakthrough. It’s an album about death: 3 kids have a friend who passes away, and they grapple with keeping his memory alive by building monuments in his memory, and bargaining to bring him back - eventually reincarnating him on “Sugar Water.” As always, the project is incredibly literary, paying homage to Toni Morrison on tracks like “Recitatif.” The features on the record are also incredibly good - all of the guest verses add a lot to the project, and I especially loved the melodic vocal performances of Anjimile and Shamir.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rock Doido, by Gaby Amarantos</p>
<p>What a trip!!! At 22 songs but only 37 minutes, this album plays out like an assault of nonstop hits that celebrate Brazilian dance music. However, its international influences and callbacks are reminiscent of an M.I.A. record - over the course of the record, there are nods to brega, reggaeton, Brazilian funk, Western popular music, and even Arabian music to some extent on “Short Beira Cu.” Listening to it from start to finish feels like the most fun it’s possible to have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GOLLIWOG, by billy woods</p>
<p>Billy Woods and his career are proof that horrorcore, while known for its shocking and cinematic elements, is also a great medium for retelling terrors of our own history and present. Over sonic backdrops that feel highly dissociative, Woods engages with images like being a vampire’s victim on “Misery,” and amputation on “Maquiladoras,” which he wrote in response to foundational anticolonialist Frantz Fanon. The record is one of his most atmospheric and has some of his most incisive songwriting to date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phantom Island, by King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard</p>
<p>Every time an artist I like has a 70’s revival album I always think to myself… is this peak? Is this the best music it’s possible to make? In this case, the answer just might be “yes,” because I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed a King Gizzard album <em>this</em> much. Loads of fun from front to back, and possibly the best arrangements on any KG album to date. The title track, “Deadstick,” and “Grow Wings and Fly” alone are all-timers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tomorrow We Escape, by HO99O9</p>
<p>A gritty, sharp record that reassures us that punk rap/rap metal doesn’t always have to be a gimmick. On <em>Tomorrow We Escape,</em> the band appear comfortable with exploring all of the extremities of their sound - “Escape” sees them create a pretty overt metal track with a sweeping chorus, and “Incline” (feat. Nova Twins, Pink Siifu &amp; Yung Skrrt) is an electrifying hip hop crossover that combines hardcore hip hop with punk aggression. Elsewhere, “Target Practice” is an industrial-influenced rager that would sound right at home on a NIN record. All in all, this is just absolutely fantastic, and had me feeling very hype every time I listened to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iconoclasts, by Anna von Hausswolff</p>
<p>On a project that feels nearly crushed by its own atmosphere, organist and vocalist Anna von Hausswolff tackles change and renewal. The soundscape she creates on this album is incredible and unique - there’s a presence of saxophone on the album (“The Beast”) that gives it jazz leanings. The heaviness of the organ is also expertly counterbalanced by Anna’s own buoyant vocals, and the two seem to work in perfect synergy. From start to finish, <em>Iconoclasts</em> is a work of truly epic proportions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Spiritual Sound, by Agriculture</p>
<p>A black metal album that rips through many extremes. I wasn’t particularly knowledgeable about all of the black metal albums that were released this year, but this one’s energy and textures caused it to linger with me significantly. With a pummelling and cathartic first side and a slow-burning and spiritual second side, <em>The Spiritual Sound</em> chronicles euphoric rebirth and vibrance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cancionera, by Natalia Lafourcade</p>
<p>Mexican folk singer-songwriter Natalia Lafourcade has basically been on a generational run since the turn of the decade, and <em>Cancionera</em> continues the magic. With the ornate orchestration of her recent records, she has really been able to show off her uncanny sense of timing - letting her compositions breathe when needed, leading to a lot of serene instrumental stretches. It’s all the more impressive that, from what I heard, the songs were recorded in one take! From front to back, a lot of tonal ground is covered - from the lightheartedness of “Cocos en la Playa” to the eeriness of “Luna Cresciente.” This makes <em>Cancionera</em> a pretty varied listen, but make no mistake - all of it is quality!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under Tangled Silence, by Djrum</p>
<p>Just an hour of gorgeous ambient IDM that will stop you in your tracks when you hear it. For an electronic album, though, it features some incredible acoustic orchestration - including spellbinding improvised piano, cello, harp, and mbira over electronic percussion. The overall sound is fluid, sweeping, and trance-like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fairyland Codex, by Tropical Fuck Storm</p>
<p>Easily the darkest and most interesting Tropical Fuck Storm record yet. While tracks like opener “Irukandji Syndrome” see the band elaborate on the noise-punk sound they're known for, the rest of the tracklist goes into deeply interesting territory. I love the Nick Cave-adjacent vibes of “Goon Show,” and the impassioned vocal performances that Fiona and Erica give on later tracks like “Teeth Marché.” Very noisy, proggy, and dark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vanisher, Horizon Scraper, by Quadeca</p>
<p>By far Quadeca’s most ambitious project, and I would say that it was a successful experiment overall. Telling the story of a life using a sea voyage as an extended metaphor, Quadeca uses both overt visuals (via his feature film-length music video for this album) and sonic storytelling to convincingly evoke the ocean. Lots of great tracks that cover everything from folk to chamber pop to experimental rock (courtesy of Maruja), and the storytelling takes on mythical proportions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phonetics On and On, by Horsegirl</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A wiry, infectious record that sees Horsegirl do a lot with a relatively subdued sound. Band members Penelope Lowenstein and Nora Cheng charmingly alternate on vocal duties, giving unpretentious vocal performances that highlight the opacity of their lyrics and the spaciousness of the songs’ mixes. It’s a simple, but refreshing indie rock listen that’s also full of pop appeal and great melodies.</p>
<ol start="38">
<li>
<p>Los Thuthanaka, by Los Thuthanaka</p>
<p>What a wild ride! As acknowledged exhaustively by Pitchfork, <em>Los Thuthanaka</em> exists at a unique and special intersection of a lot of sounds. Specifically, it combines indigenous tradition and digital noise. “Phuju” is a huayño, a festive Andean dance, that is also full of noisy synths and DJ tags. “Apnaqkaya Titi” and “Awila” subvert traditional Bolivian dances with pummelling punk guitars and drums. It is the best and most dizzying kind of fusional, anticolonialist music - and it’s so maximalist that you really have to listen to it yourself to believe what’s happening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cabin in the Sky, by De La Soul</p>
<p>Given the tragic subtext of this record following the passing of Trugoy the Dove, it was difficult to imagine how De La Soul would move forward. <em>Cabin in the Sky</em> sees the group address the loss by celebrating his life, and consequently, the project never feels particularly heavy. There are great features from both legends and newcomers that are transparently and humorously outlined by the album intro. The resulting project is one that manages to entertain the listener as De La Soul always have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hymnal, by Lyra Pramuk</p>
<p>On <em>Hymnal,</em> Pramuk flexes her capability of making expansive, futuristic soundscapes with organic ingredients. There are sweeping, energetic string arrangements and the uncanny patchwork melodies that Pramuk weaves with her own voice. Overall, the sound she creates feels ancient, elemental, and futuristic at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HAGEN, by Titanic</p>
<p>A great release from the Mexico City duo consisting of cellist Mabe Fratti and guitarist Héctor Tosta. As a cellist myself, I have been so excited by Mabe Fratti’s career in particular, and this record was no exception. The cello serves as a grounding, earthy force on this record as the duo make songs that feel expansive and experimental, but still have a surprising degree of infectiousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Laini Tani, by Nadah El Shazly</p>
<p>Following the release of her 2017 debut <em>Ahwar,</em> Cairo-born Nadah El Shazly has expanded her career through film scoring. <em>Laini Tani</em> sees her finally return to recording her own music, and the results are wondrous. Combining Arab classical music melodies with electronics and dream pop, <em>Laini Tani</em> is a lush and expansive listen that almost feels trancelike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BABY, by Dijon</p>
<p>A maximal and collage-like record that combines the soulfulness of 90’s-2000’s silk-shirt R&amp;B with restless experimentation in a similar vein to his colleague, mk.gee. As a result, it stutters and bursts with emotion and vibrance, producing moments that can be relentlessly funky and full of pop shimmer - in a way, like a 21st century Prince. The whole project is stellar, but “Yamaha” in particular is a tune that I would love to shout from the rooftops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alan Sparhawk with Trampled By Turtles, by Alan Sparhawk &amp; Trampled By Turtles</p>
<p>Grief-stricken but hopeful, <em>With Trampled By Turtles</em> is a set of musical gut-punches. The instrumentation provided by bluegrass band Trampled By Turtles is a perfect, warm backdrop for these tracks that see Alan Sparhawk process the loss of his partner, Mimi Parker. It’s gorgeous and vulnerable, truly mining gold from a collaboration that feels unlikely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every Video Without Your Face, Every Sound Without Your Name, by Lucy Liyou</p>
<p>A set of haunting, austere songs led by piano and vocals that interrogates the aftermath of relationships and familial trauma. While making use of space and silence in the recordings to build emotion, many tracks also reach spellbinding peaks through ambient synths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THE BPM, by Sudan Archives</p>
<p>On her expansive follow-up to 2023’s <em>Natural Brown Prom Queen,</em> Sudan Archives continues her relentless musical exploration and pop prowess  as she documents love, ambition, and daily anxieties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Danchi Thesis, by Shinsei Kamattechan</p>
<p>Bursting with frenetic energy, <em>Danchi Thesis</em> is genuinely one of the zaniest records I listened to in 2025, combining high-energy J-rock with indietronica and occasional string arrangements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8 Tips for Catastrophe Living, by Asher White</p>
<p>From post-rock to folk to electronic music, Asher White dabbles in a bit of everything as she processes romantic strife. The results are virtuosic, but have a bit of humor and playfulness as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like a Ribbon, by John Glacier</p>
<p>Amidst her stoic, deadpan rapping style, John Glacier’s debut sees her unflappably tackle a myriad of soundscapes while documenting her own personal and musical growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moneyball, by Dutch Interior</p>
<p>An incredibly warm effort that combines slowcore and Americana to stunning effect. The subdued performances on much of the record allow for its gorgeous textures to shine through.</p>
