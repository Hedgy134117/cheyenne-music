Endless Bright Horizon, by Juan Berdugo 

A gorgeous, expansive art-rock/chamber pop with very deliberate pacing \- one of the year’s most contemplative records.

End of the Middle, by Richard Dawson

Perhaps more straightforward and less psychedelic than his other work, *End of the Middle* is still a thoughtful entry in Dawson’s catalog.

Birthing, by Swans

My favorite band\!\!\! Gira & co. truly do post-rock like no one else, and I was fortunate to see them live (9/5 in Washington D.C.) during this era which was a rapturous experience.

viagr aboys, by Viagra Boys

These freaky ass guys are back at it again\! If you liked them before, you’ll probably like them now\!

Animaru, by mei semones

A bit of chamber pop, a bit of bossa nova, and a bit of J-pop make for a refreshing, polished album.

Tranquilizer, by Oneohtrix Point Never

On this album, Oneohtrix pulls from commercial sample CDs to make a transient, ethereal album.

A Danger to Ourselves, by Lucrecia Dalt

While presenting very much like a pop album, Lucrecia Dalt concocts a lot of chin-scratching environments here by combining organic and industrial sounds in her instrumentals.

The Film, by Sumac & Moor Mother

Combining Moor Mother’s Afrofuturist insurgency and the larger-than-life physicality of Sumac’s post-metal sound makes for one of 2025’s most apocalyptic listens.

Switcheroo, by Gelli haha

Every time I think I tire of synth-driven indie pop, a fun little catchy release pulls me back in. In this case, it was Gelli haha’s kooky, effervescent alternative dance debut record *Switcheroo.*

In the Blue Light, by Kelela

On the best live album of 2025, Kelela revisits songs across her discography with lush, harp-kissed arrangements.

GUSH, by Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith

Forgoing some of her ambient textures for pulsing, deep basslines and sultry vocals, Smith concocted a record containing some of her most fun and sensual work.

Stardust, by Danny Brown

As explorative as ever, *Stardust* sees a legend collaborate with some of the most exciting up-and-coming artists/producers in experimental pop to expand his sound.

Sincerely, by Kali Uchis

This is a great Kali Uchis record, and stands with some of her best work\! Just infinitely timeless, gorgeously sung and arranged.

Through the Wall, by Rochelle Jordan

Hypnotic, groovy, and nocturnal \- after experimenting with many other electronic subgenres prior to now, *Through the Wall* sees Jordan embrace the sensual vibe of 90’s house.

A Study of Losses, by Beirut

On this expansive, brilliantly orchestrated album, Beirut chronicles impermanence to moving effect.

Welcome to My Blue Sky, by Momma

A road album that unpacks tales of longing and infidelity amid fuzzy, 90’s-indebted alt-rock.

Bugland, by No Joy

An immersive shoegaze-inspired record that is rife with thick guitars, digital textures and maximalism.

Touch, by Tortoise

With *Touch,* the post-rock veterans have returned with some of their most cinematic work in years, while keeping the overall sound pretty light.

Vegetables Worldwide, by vgtbl.pl

A bold, undeniably fun follow up to the Polish hyperpop duo’s electrifying *Komputer* EP.

The New Eve Is Rising, by The New Eves

Harkening avant-folk as well as more free form strains of post punk, The New Eves offer a boundary-pushing rebirth of womanhood on this ambitious album.

You’re Weird Now, by Guerilla Toss

On this quirky and well-crafted record, Guerilla Toss is at their most playful and delivers some of their catchiest songs yet (“Psychosis Is Just a Number” and “Life’s a Zoo”).

La Belleza, by Lido Pimienta

A brief, but heavenly string-laden effort.

For Melancholy Brunettes (& Sad Women), by Japanese Breakfast

Michelle Zauner’s latest country-tinged effort offers some of her strongest orchestration, and both “Men in Bars” and “Winter in L.A.” are some of the best songs she has ever put out.

A Paradise in the Hold, by Yazz Ahmed

A standout jazz album from 2025 that explores the British-Bahraini trumpeter’s cultural identity.

Worldwide, by Snõõper

Sõ glad that Snõõper returned with their sõphõmõre effõrt this year\!\!\! They make egg-punk like nõ õne else can. 

I remember I forget, by Yasmine Hamdan

A gorgeous effort that combines Arab music with a number of different styles, from trip hop to ambient music.

DOGA, by Juana Molina

With strangely sticky melodies and eerie ambient electronics, *DOGA* is a fascinating record \- I also am a fan of the album cover\!
