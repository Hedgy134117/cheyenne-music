This is a fantastic jazz fusion record\! Earlier in the year, I actually took a “History of Jazz” course at my university for fun, and reaped a lot of great recommendations from that\! When learning about Brazilian jazz, I particularly took to the work of Flora Purim \- she has a way of using her voice as an instrument, sometimes wordlessly, and reaches a lot of creative peaks on this LP with the support of stellar instrumentalists that include her husband Airto Moreira, Carlos Santana, George Duke, and Ron Carter. The overall sound is vibrant and incredibly lyrical \- whether passages are being led by Flora herself or by soloists in her incredible ensemble.
