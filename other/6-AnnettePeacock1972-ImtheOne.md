An album that is both delightful and uncompromising. From the start with the opening title track, Peacock combines the soulful vocal acrobatics of Laura Nyro with the jazzy noir vibes of Patty Waters (along with a hint of Patti Smith’s swagger) to great effect. Additionally, *I’m the One* was recorded in a series of single takes recorded live, giving it a jazz feel, while also offering some of the most insane-sounding synth experimentation of the early 70’s. On nearly every track, Peacock processes her own vocals with Moog synthesizers, but never at the expense of the raw power of her vocal range.

While this album is spacey and experimental, many of its moments are infectious, or at the very least rewarding for a patient listener. The swaggering funk-rock of the opening title track is certainly a highlight, but the whirring synths of later tracks like “Been & Gone” and “Blood” also offer an otherworldly experience. Just completely in a league of its own, whether you consider it in the context of 1972 or broadly.
