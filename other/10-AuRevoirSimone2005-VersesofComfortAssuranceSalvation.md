Just a quaint mid-2000’s indie debut that really spoke to me this year, discovered by looking through a list of albums that David Lynch enjoyed \- saying that they “really \[made him\] dream.” It’s a fantastic vibe, influenced by synth pop and folktronica, and naturally grazed by 2000’s twee. It also has a very bifurcated feeling, with the first half of the record having a much more playful vibe than the more atmospheric, sinister second half. I also enjoy the lyrics quite a bit \- they are often very fanciful, with magical imagery (“Then the moon swept down to greet us/It was warm and made of flowers”). At a breezy 28 minutes, Au Revoir Simone’s debut still holds as a pleasant, dreamy respite from reality.
