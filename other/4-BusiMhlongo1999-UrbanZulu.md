*Urban Zulu* is a seminal South African album, and one of several albums on this list that I found via beehype’s “Special: Classic Albums from Around the World.” While its album cover leaves a bit to be desired, Mhlongo’s *Urban Zulu* redefined maskandi: a form of Zulu folk music with percussive guitar techniques and commonly associated with South Africa’s male migrant worker population. With her unforgettable voice, Mhlongo combined this folk tradition with modern, international influences to create a gorgeous listening experience, and was solidified as a female trailblazer in South African music.  

<!-- excerpt -->

While being mainly rooted in the maskandi sound, there is a diverse array of beautiful sounds to be found on *Urban Zulu*. “Yise Wabant’a Bami (Father of My Children)” is a gorgeous guitar-led ballad that would sound at home on a folk record from decades before. However, “Zithin’Lzizwe” is a highlight that better represents the overall sound of the album, with a transcendental repeated melodic refrain that’s supported by propulsive guitar-picking and Mhlongo’s own vocal modulations.
