As someone who has been interested in art pop and experimental pop for years, I find it so very baffling that I did not find this album until 2025\. What’s more is I actually discovered it on a random album generator (Shfl) when I wanted to listen to something new. That being said, ESKA’s self-titled 2015 debut was absolutely one of my favorite discoveries of this year, and one of the most kaleidoscopic records I had in rotation.  

<!-- excerpt -->

Musically, *ESKA* falls somewhere in between soul and folk music, and has a highly organic, pastoral sound with many unusual instrumental choices. For example, “Shades of Blue,” combines Asian-inspired arrangements of sitar (or rather, guitars that sound like sitars) with a reggae-influenced groove. Her vocals are incredibly emotive and acrobatic \- on “Gatekeeper” alone, she growls like early Björk, and shows flexibility in her upper register that warrants comparison to Moses Sumney. Often, it feels like ESKA is tapping into something incredibly ancient and rustic with her music, which is reinforced by folklorical lyrics on songs like “She’s in the Flowers,” a folk jig inspired by Persephone.
