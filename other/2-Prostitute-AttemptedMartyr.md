One of the most dizzying, lacerating noise rock debuts I’ve heard in a long time. Uniquely, Prostitute combines the genre with influences from Arab music \- particularly evident in the first half of this record, such as “Judge.” All the while, frontman Moe Kazra delivers unforgiving lyrics about his experiences with xenophobia while being Lebanese in the U.S., while also tackling more taboo themes like hedonistic desire on “Joumana Kayrouz.” It’s certainly an electrifying listen, and makes me excited for what the band might do next.
