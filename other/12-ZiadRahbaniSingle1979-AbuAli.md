Just a great work of disco music made by none other than Ziad Rahbani \- the son of Lebanese music legend Fairouz, who went on to have an incredible career in his own right. *Abu Ali* is a 13-minute single that wordlessly takes on disco and funk music, creating a majestic and cinematic musical journey. The string and horn arrangements are fantastic, and there is use of ney flute and hand drums that bring the track a distinctly Levantine sound. There are plenty of other places to venture with Rahbani’s work, but this legendary single is certainly a good starting point.
