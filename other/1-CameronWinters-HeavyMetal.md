Before the release of *Getting Killed* this year \- an album that combines Winter and co’s knack for alt rock songwriting and more sophisticated jazz-influenced experimentation, Winter released a solo album showing off his songwriting abilities in late 2024\. *Heavy Metal* is both casual and airtight, and Winter’s distinct voice works incredibly well in a singer-songwriter context.   

<!-- excerpt -->

The timeless sound of this record is what truly sells it. The late 60’s/early 70’s Wurlitzer-fueled soul of “Nausicaa” makes it astonishingly sweet and catchy. The austere piano ballad “Drinking Age" gives way to one of the most gratifying climaxes of the album, as does the slow crescendo and group vocals of single “0$.” Despite its classic sound, the record still manages to teeter on wooziness and unease, making it feel like an impressionistic incantation of a vintage 70’s album.
