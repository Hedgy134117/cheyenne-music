The first of 2 bonus not-quite-albums that I wanted to include on this list: POiSON GiRL FRiEND may be one of my most treasured discoveries of 2025\. Her EP *MELTING MOMENT* is particularly lush \- along with being irresistibly romantic and international. There are icy trip-hop beats, synthetic but warm beds of strings, and pining in English, French, and Japanese. It’s equally clubbish and dreamy, feeling as indebted to the French yé-yé girls like Francoise Hardy as it does to 90’s electronic and trip hop.
