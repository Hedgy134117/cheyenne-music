A lovely late 90’s Argentinian work of trip hop, blending the genre with elements of dream pop, downtempo, and neo-psychedelia. On track after track, Cerati lets his layered production shine through his ethereal work on the instrumentation. His vocals are great, too \- he sings very passionately and concocts some enthralling choruses and hooks on the album.  

<!-- excerpt -->

Throughout the record, and notably on tracks like “Beautiful” Cerati implements some 70’s-flavored jazz and soft rock stylings into his sound that help to build a very sensual atmosphere. Elsewhere, he taps into folktronica on “Perdonar es Divino,” and uses lush shoegaze-tinged guitars on “Paseo Inmoral.” Similar to how *OK Computer* saw Radiohead move into psychedelia and electronic-tinged atmospherics, *Bocanada* feels a lot like Cerati’s offering to the omnivorous and futuristic sound of alternative music in the late 90’s.
